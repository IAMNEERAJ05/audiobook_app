How? You'll find out in\nthe pages of A Second Chance: The Story of a Near-Death Experience.\nYou'll also learn many vital truths about the fundamental nature of the\nself and reality, so you can better prepare yourself for your own inevitable\nencounters with death and dying.\nEven today, people momentarily on the verge of death report encounters\nlike Ajāmila's, lending credibility to the idea that there is life after death.\nIn 1982, George Gallup, Jr., published a book called Adventures in\nImmortality, which contained results of a survey on American beliefs about\nthe afterlife, including near-death and out-of-body experiences.\nSixty-seven percent of the people surveyed said they believe in life after\ndeath, and fifteen percent said they themselves had had some kind of near-\ndeath experience.\nThe people who reported a near-death experience were then asked to\ndescribe it. Nine percent reported an out-of-body sensation, and eight\npercent felt that \"a special being or beings were present during the near-\ndeath experience.\"\nThe Gallup survey is intriguing, but it leaves unanswered this basic\nquestion: Is there any scientific evidence for near-death experiences,\nparticularly of the out-of-body type?\nApparently there is-from studies of people on the verge of death who,\nwhile supposedly unconscious, accurately report events relating to their\nphysical body from a perspective outside it. Heart attack patients, accident\nvictims, and soldiers wounded in battle have all reported such experiences.\nDr. Michael Sabom, a cardiologist at the Emory University Medical\nSchool, undertook a scientific study of such reports. He interviewed thirty-\ntwo cardiac-arrest patients who reported out-of-body experiences. During a\ncardiac arrest the heart stops pumping blood to the brain, and so a patient\nshould be totally unconscious. Yet twenty-six of the thirty-two patients\nreporting out-of-body experiences during cardiac arrest were able to give"

He concluded that the mind was an entity distinct\nfrom the brain and that the near-death crisis caused the mind and brain to\nsplit apart for a brief time. Sabom wrote, \"Could the mind which splits apart\nfrom the physical brain be, in essence, the soul, which continues to exist\nafter the final bodily death, according to some religious doctrines? As I see\nit, this is the ultimate question that has been raised by reports of the NDE\n[near-death experience].\"\nThe true dimensions of that ultimate question are thoroughly explored in\nA Second Chance, by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\nPrabhupāda, the founding spiritual master (ācārya) of the International\nSociety for Krishna Consciousness.\nThousands of years ago in India, the history concerning Ajāmila and his\nnear-death experience was related by the great spiritual master Śukadeva\nGosvāmī to his disciple King Parīkṣit. Their conversation is recorded in the\nSixth Canto of the Sanskrit classic Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, renowned as the\nripened fruit of the tree of India's timeless Vedic literature.\nIn 1975–76, in the course of translating the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam into\nEnglish, Śrīla Prabhupāda translated the story of Ajāmila. And as with the\nrest of the work, in addition to the text he provided an illuminating\ncommentary on each verse.\nBut this wasn't the first time Śrīla Prabhupāda had explained the story of\nAjāmila. During the winter of 1970–71 Śrīla Prabhupāda was traveling with\nsome of his Western disciples in India. They had heard him speak about\nAjāmila several times, and at their request he now gave a systematic series\nof lectures on the Ajāmila story.\nThus A Second Chance consists of texts from the Sixth Canto of Śrīmad-\nBhāgavatam (reproduced here in boldface type), selections from Śrīla\nPrabhupāda's commentary, and excerpts from transcriptions of his lectures\nduring the '70–71 India tour."

Ajāmila\ngave trouble to others by arresting them, by cheating them in gambling, or by directly\nplundering them. This was the way he earned his livelihood and maintained his wife and\nchildren. (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.21–22)\nThe Law of Consequences\nAlthough Ajāmila was born of a brāhmaṇa father and strictly followed\nthe regulative principles-no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, and\nno gambling-he fell in love with a prostitute, and therefore all his good\nqualities were lost. As soon as a person abandons the regulative principles,\nhe engages in various kinds of sinful activities. The regulative principles\nserve to keep us on the standard of human life. But if we abandon them, we\nfall down into illusory life, or māyā.\nIf we want to advance in spiritual life, we must follow the regulative\nprinciples and rectify the mistakes of our past lives and this present life.\nOnly those who have become free from all kinds of sinful reactions and are\nnow engaged in pious activities can fully understand God. Persons who\ncommit sinful activities and who are overly attached to bodily comforts and\nmundane friendship, society, and family affection cannot be spiritually self-\nrealized.\nThe fault of illicit connection with women is that it destroys all one's\nbrahminical qualities. Ajāmila abandoned all the regulative principles due\nto his association with a prostitute. He became a cheater and a thief. One\nwho acts dishonestly will be punished. He may escape the king's or\ngovernment's law, but he can never escape God's law. The materialists\nthink, \"I am cheating God, and I can continue to gratify my senses by all\nnefarious activities.\" But the śāstras (scriptures) state that such persons are\ncheating their own happiness in the end, because they will have to accept a\nmaterial body again and suffer accordingly."

The great\nsages and ṛṣis throughout the world have given guidance, and their words\nare recorded in the śāstras. But rascals and fools misinterpret the scriptures\nand misguide the people. At present, the Bhagavad-gītā is interpreted in so\nmany different ways, and these so-called explanations are accepted by the\ninnocent public as authoritative knowledge. One interpreter explains that\nthe battlefield of Kurukṣetra refers to the material body and that the five\nPāṇḍava brothers are really the five senses of the material body. But this is\nnot the proper understanding. How can anyone explain the Bhagavad-gītā\nwhen he does not understand it? Such an attempt is nonsense.\nTo understand the bona fide science of God, one must approach a bona\nfide spiritual master and hear the Bhagavad-gītā from him. We have to\nfollow the great personalities, the previous ācāryas (spiritual masters). That\nwill be to our profit. We should not speculate and make up our own\nstatements. We should simply accept the injunctions given by the great\nācāryas, because that is the process of the Vedic system. One must\napproach a bona fide spiritual master and inquire from him submissively.\nThe Absolute Truth is explained in the scriptures, and the scriptures are\nexplained by the spiritual master or a saintly person.

Therefore we are presenting the Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.\nThe Degradation of Modern Society\nHere the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam says that the brāhmaṇa Ajāmila became\nattached to a prostitute and thus lost his brahminical qualifications. He was\na young man of about twenty when this happened. Because of his illicit\nassociation with the prostitute, Ajāmila was forced to live by begging,\nborrowing, stealing, and gambling.\nThese verses indicate how degraded one becomes simply by indulging in\nillicit sex with a prostitute. Illicit sex is not possible with chaste women, but\nonly with unchaste women. The more society allows prostitution and illicit\nsex, the more impetus it gives to cheaters, thieves, plunderers, drunkards,\nand gamblers. Therefore we first advise all the disciples in our Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness movement to avoid illicit sex, which is the beginning of all\nabominable life and which is followed by meat-eating, gambling, and\nintoxication, one after another. Of course, restraint is difficult, but it is quite\npossible if one fully surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, since all abominable habits\ngradually become distasteful for a Kṛṣṇa conscious person.\nWhile in his time Ajāmila was an exception, in the present age there are\nmillions of Ajāmilas. But if illicit sex is allowed to increase, the entire\nsociety will be condemned, for it will be full of rogues, thieves, cheaters,\nand so forth.\nTherefore, if we actually want to improve the world situation, we have to\ntake to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as that gives the best service to human society,\nboth materially and spiritually. Whatever abominable characteristics we\nhave developed, we have only to take to the process of bhakti-yoga, or\ndevotional service, in order to completely eradicate them. We have\ndeveloped so many anarthas, or unwanted habits, the chief of which are\nmeat-eating, intoxication, illicit sex, and gambling. But we can curb them\nby accepting the principles of bhakti-yoga as they are presented in the\nBhagavad-gītā and the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Scarcely anyone knows these\nVedic scriptures, and therefore no one heeds their instructions. People\nwould rather read all kinds of books by all kinds of rascals, but the result of\nsuch books is to kill Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

But at present almost no one can follow this process, and\nartificial attempts at yoga will not help us.\nTherefore to help the fallen people of this Age of Kali, the Supreme Lord\nappeared five hundred years ago as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He knew that\nthe people of this age would not even be able to follow the regulative\nprinciples, what to speak of practicing aṣṭāṅga-yoga.

Other processes of\npurification or sacrifice cannot be followed in this age, because for the most\npart people are too degraded. But anyone may take to this process of\nchanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

And to guarantee offenseless chanting, some austerity is\nrequired. First of all, one should not indulge in illicit sex.

Family responsibility is very great;\ntherefore if a man feels he cannot accept the responsibility, he should\nremain a brahmacārī, a celibate student. A person who practices the science\nof brahmacarya under the care of a spiritual master automatically becomes\nseventy-five percent free from material entanglement.\nToday, however, no one wants to undergo the austerities of\nbrahmacarya. Everyone wants to remain unmarried but also engage in sex.\nIn this way people are losing all good character. To maintain a woman who\nis nothing more than a prostitute and engage in illicit sex with her for\nproducing children is sinful. Such children are unwanted (varṇa-saṅkara),\nand in this way society becomes degraded.\nAjāmila became attracted to a prostitute, and with her he begot ten\nchildren. He became so degraded that he could not execute honest business\nto support his large family, and he was forced to beg, borrow, and steal to\nmaintain them. If a person indulges in illicit sex, intoxication and gambling\nautomatically follow. His expenses will be unlimited, and to meet all his\nexpenses he will have to adopt methods of cheating and stealing. The basis\nfor Ajāmila's degradation was his illicit connection with the prostitute.\nTherefore, in the practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness we do not allow any\nillicit sex. Devotees must either get married or remain celibate; this\nregulation is very effective for maintaining a high standard of purity."

The youngest child was a baby named Nārāyaṇa, who was naturally very\ndear to his father and mother. (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.23–24)\nParental Affection\nAjāmila's sinfulness is shown by the fact that although he was eighty-\neight years old, he had a very young child. According to Vedic culture, one\nshould leave home as soon as he has reached fifty years of age; one should\nnot live at home and go on producing children. Sex is allowed for twenty-\nfive years, between the ages of twenty-five and fifty. After that one should\ngive up the habit of sex and leave home as a vānaprastha and then properly\ntake sannyāsa. Ajāmila, however, because of his association with a\nprostitute, lost all brahminical culture and became most sinful, even in his\nso-called household life.\nAjāmila was a young man of twenty when he met the prostitute, and he\nbegot ten children in her. When he was almost ninety years old, the time\ncame when he was to die. At that time most of his children were grown up,\nso naturally the youngest child, Nārāyaṇa, became his parents' favorite, and\nAjāmila was very much attached to him.\nA baby's smile immediately attracts the father, mother, and relatives.\nWhen the child begins to talk, making sounds in broken language, it is very\njoyful for the parents. Unless this attraction is there, it is not possible to\nraise the child with affection. Parental affection is natural even among the\nanimal species. In Kanpura, a monkey once came with her baby near the\nroom where we were staying. The baby monkey entered the window\nthrough the bars, and the mother became very upset. She became mad with\nanxiety. Somehow or other we pushed the baby monkey out of the bars, and\nimmediately the mother embraced the baby and took it away with her."

Therefore it is not an outstanding qualification; it is material\nnature's law. Unless the mother and child are affectionately connected, it is\nnot possible for the child to grow up. Parental affection is natural and\nnecessary, but it does not raise one to the spiritual platform.\nThe character of the debauchee Ajāmila was abominable, but he was still\nvery affectionate toward his youngest child. Although Ajāmila was nearly\nninety, he was still enjoying the child's playful pastimes, just as Mahārāja\nNanda and mother Yaśodā enjoyed the childhood pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa.\nSpiritual Affection and Variety\nParental affection in this material world is a perverted reflection of\nparental affection in the spiritual world, where it is found in its pure,\noriginal form. Everything originates with the transcendental reality. As\nstated in the Vedānta-sūtra (1.1.2), janmādy asya yataḥ: [SB 1.1.1] \"The\nSupreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates.\" If the\naffection between a child and his parents did not exist in the Absolute Truth,\nit could not exist in the material world.\nSince the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, whatever varieties\nwe see here in this material world are simply reflections of the varieties in\nthe spiritual world. If the Absolute Truth were without variety, then where\nhave all these varieties come from? No, the Absolute Truth is not\nimpersonal (nirākāra) or without variety (nirviśeṣa).\nStill, some persons, called Māyāvādīs, are so disappointed and frustrated\nwith the imperfect varieties of this material world that they imagine the\nspiritual world to be impersonal and without variety. These impersonalists\nrealize that they are Brahman, or spirit, but they do not know that there are\ninnumerable planets in the brahmajyoti, or spiritual atmosphere. They think\nthat the brahmajyoti itself is all-in-all. The impersonalists have no\ninformation of the Vaikuṇṭha planets, and due to their imperfect knowledge\nthey again come down to these material planets. As said in the Śrīmad-\nBhāgavatam (10.2.32):\nye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas\ntvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ"

Nor do they\ndifferentiate between the material form and God's form. They are convinced\nthat the impersonal brahmajyoti, the spiritual effulgence emanating from\nthe Lord's body, is the Supreme Absolute Truth. The Māyāvādīs mistakenly\nassume that when God appears He accepts a material body, just as we have\ntaken this material form in the material world. That kind of thinking is\nimpersonalism, or Māyāvāda philosophy.\nGod has a form, but not a material form like ours. His form is sac-cid-\nānanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1], a spiritual form full of eternity, bliss, and\nknowledge. Anyone who understands the transcendental nature of Kṛṣṇa's\nform achieves perfection. This Kṛṣṇa confirms in the Bhagavad-gītā (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ\ntyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma\nnaiti mām eti so 'rjuna\n\"When I come, I do not accept a material body; My birth and activities are\ncompletely spiritual.

So God can display Himself\nexactly like an ordinary human being, yet He remains the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead.\nImpersonalists cannot know God because they see Him as an ordinary\nman. This is rascaldom, as Kṛṣṇa declares in the Bhagavad-gītā (9.11):\navajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ. \"Only rascals accept Me as an ordinary human\nbeing.\" The Māyā-vādīs say, \"Oh, here is a child.

Anyone\ncan claim to be God, and any foolish person can accept, but no one will\nbenefit by serving a false God.\nOnce Lord Brahmā thought that Kṛṣṇa might also be such a false God.\nHe observed that a mere boy in Vṛndāvana, India, was accepted as the\nSupreme Lord and that He was performing extraordinary activities. So\nBrahmā decided to make a test. He took away all of Kṛṣṇa's calves and\nplaymates and hid them. When Brahmā returned to Vṛndāvana after one\nyear and saw the same calves and playmates still there, he could understand\nthat Kṛṣṇa had expanded Himself by His unlimited potency into so many\ncalves and boys. The boys' own mothers could not detect that their sons\nwere Kṛṣṇa's expansions, though the mothers could not explain why every\nevening when their boys returned home from the fields, their affection for\nthem increased more and more. Finally, Brahmā surrendered to Kṛṣṇa,\ncomposing very nice prayers in glorification of the Lord.\nSimilarly, Indra became bewildered when Kṛṣṇa told His father, Nanda\nMahārāja, \"There is no need of performing sacrifices to Indra, because he is\nunder the order of the Supreme Lord.\" Kṛṣṇa did not say to Nanda\nMahārāja, \"I am the Supreme Lord,\" but He said, \"Indra is under the order\nof the Supreme Lord; therefore he has to supply you with water. So there is\nno need of performing this yajña [sacrifice] to him.\"\nWhen the sacrifice to Indra was stopped, he became furious and tried to\npunish the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana by sending incessant torrents of rain"

Since the old man was very attached\nto the child, he enjoyed the child's activities, and because the child's name\nwas Nārāyaṇa, the old man always chanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa.\nAlthough Ajāmila was referring to the small child and not to the original\nNārāyaṇa, the name of Nārāyaṇa is so powerful that even by chanting his\nson's name he was becoming purified. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has therefore\ndeclared that if one's mind is somehow or other attracted by the holy name\nof Kṛṣṇa (tasmāt kenāpy upāyena manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet), one is on the\npath of liberation. In India even today parents often give their children\nnames of God, such as Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, or Nārāyaṇa. Thus the parents chant\nthe names Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, or Nārāyaṇa and get the chance to be purified.\nAt the time of death, Ajāmila was chanting the name of Nārāyaṇa in\nconnection with his youngest child. Since Ajāmila was the son of a\nbrāhmaṇa, he had been accustomed to worshiping Nārāyaṇa in his youth,\nbecause in every brāhmaṇa's house there is worship of Nārāyaṇa.\nTherefore, although the contaminated Ajāmila was calling for his son, by\nconcentrating his mind on the holy name of Nārāyaṇa he remembered the\nNārāyaṇa he had very faithfully worshiped in his youth.\nThe value of remembering Nārāyaṇa at the time of death is explained in\nthe Second Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (2.1.6):"

But if we become complacent and think, \"Oh, death takes place-\nwhat of it?\" then we cannot advance on the spiritual path. Just as the air\ncarries fragrances, so a person's mentality at the time of death will carry him\nto his next life. If he has cultivated the mentality of a Vaiṣṇava, a pure\ndevotee of Kṛṣṇa, then he will immediately be transferred to Vaikuṇṭha. But\nif he has cultivated the mentality of an ordinary karmī, a fruitive worker,\nthen he will have to stay in this material world to suffer the consequences of\nthe kind of mentality he has thus created.\nSuppose I am a businessman. If I simply do business up till the point of\ndeath, naturally my mentality will be business. One Calcutta businessman at\nthe time of death asked about the management of his mill. He might have\ntaken his next birth as a rat in his mill. This is possible. At the time of death,\nwhatever you are thinking will carry you to your next body. Kṛṣṇa is very\nkind, and whatever mentality one is absorbed in at the time of death, Kṛṣṇa\nwill provide an appropriate body: \"All right, you are thinking like a rat?\nBecome a rat.\" \"You are thinking like a tiger? Become a tiger.\" \"You are\nthinking like My devotee? Come to Me.\"\nBy chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, we can mold our thoughts so that we are\nalways thinking of Kṛṣṇa. As Kṛṣṇa recommends in the Bhagavad-gītā\n(6.47), yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā: \"The first-class yogī\nis he who always thinks of Me within his heart.\" The Kṛṣṇa consciousness\nmovement is especially meant for helping the members of human society"

In illusion a man thinks, \"My\nbank balance, my nice house, and my family will protect me.\" But these\ncannot protect anyone. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (2.1.4) declares,\ndehāpatya-kalatrādiṣv\nātma-sainyeṣv asatsv api\nteṣāṁ pramatto nidhanaṁ\npaśyann api na paśyati\n\"One who is mad thinks, 'My strong body, my grown-up children, my good\nwife, and my bank balance will save me.' \" We are simply struggling in this\nmaterial world like soldiers fighting on a battlefield. Our soldiers are our\nchildren, our wife, our bank balance, our countrymen, etc. The Śrīmad-\nBhāgavatam warns us not to take shelter of such fallible soldiers. Even\nthough a man has seen that his father and grandfather, who were once\nliving, are existing no more, he does not see that likewise everyone,\nincluding himself, will be destroyed. How can he protect his son? How can\nhis son protect him? These questions do not arise for the materialist who is\nsimply engrossed in the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending,\nand mating."

With ropes in their\nhands, they had come to take him away to the abode of Yamarāja. When he saw them he was\nextremely bewildered, and because of attachment to his child, who was playing nearby, Ajāmila\nbegan to call him loudly by his name. Thus with tears in his eyes he somehow or other chanted\nthe holy name of Nārāyaṇa. (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.28–29)\nAnxious to Save Themselves from Death\nAt the time of death people become very anxious to save themselves,\nespecially those who have been sinful. Of course, the soul itself is not\nsubject to death (na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre [Bg. 2.20]), but leaving the\npresent body and entering into another body is very painful. At death the\nliving entity can no longer bear to remain in his present body-the pain is so\nacute. Sometimes when a person's life becomes too painful he commits\nsuicide. But suicide is a sin punishable by the laws of karma.\nWhen Ajāmila was dying, he saw three ferocious and very frightening\npersons with ropes in their hands, unruly hair on their heads, and bodily hair\nlike bristles. These assistants of Yamarāja, the Yamadūtas, had come to drag\nAjāmila out of his body and take him to the court of Yamarāja. Sometimes a\ndying man cries out in fear when he sees the Yamadūtas. Ajāmila, too,\nbecame very fearful.\nFortunately, even though Ajāmila was referring to his son, he chanted the\nholy name of Nārāyaṇa, and therefore the order-carriers of Nārāyaṇa, the\nViṣṇudūtas, also immediately arrived there. Because Ajāmila was extremely\nafraid of the ropes of Yamarāja, he chanted the Lord's name with tearful\neyes. Actually, however, he never meant to chant the holy name of\nNārāyaṇa; he meant to call his son.\nThe Appearance and Disappearance Of Kṛṣṇa and His Devotees\nOne may ask, \"The devotees die, and the nondevotees also die. What is\nthe difference?\" It is like this: The mother cat may catch a rat and carry it in\nher mouth, and she also carries her kittens in her mouth. It is the same"

Similarly, at the time of death the devotees are transferred\nto the spiritual realm, Vaikuṇṭha, whereas the ordinary sinful man is\ndragged down to the hellish regions by the Yamadūtas, the constables of\nYama-rāja. This was apparently to be Ajāmila's fate.\nIn the Bhagavad-gītā (4.9) Kṛṣṇa says, janma karma ca me divyam: \"My\nappearance and disappearance are spiritual, transcendental; they are not\nordinary.\" Why does Kṛṣṇa appear in this world? That He explains in the\nprevious verse (Bg. 4.8):\nparitrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ\nvināśāya ca duṣkṛtām\ndharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya\nsambhavāmi yuge yuge\n\"To deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish\nthe principles of religion, I appear millennium after millennium.\" God's\nonly business is to protect the faithful devotees and to kill the demoniac.\nTherefore we find Lord Viṣṇu pictured with His weapons, the club and\ncakra (disc), for protecting the devotees, and the lotus flower and conch for\ntheir benediction.\nSimilarly transcendental are the appearance and disappearance of Kṛṣṇa's\ndevotees who are sent to this material world to preach the glories of the\nLord. According to the principles of Vaiṣṇavism, both the appearance and\nthe disappearance of such Vaiṣṇavas, or devotees of Viṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa), are all-\nauspicious. Therefore we hold festivals in their honor on the anniversaries\nof both days.\nActually, even ordinary living entities never take birth or die, what to\nspeak of Kṛṣṇa and His devotees. Sometimes atheistic men say God is dead.\nThey do not know that even the smallest living entity does not die. So how\ncan God be dead? Atheists are described in the Bhagavad-gītā as mūḍhās,\nor foolish rascals. They have no knowledge but pose themselves as learned\nmen and mutter something that is good neither for them nor the public.\nLiberation via Thinking of Kṛṣṇa\nBecause somehow or other Ajāmila became absorbed in thinking of\nNārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, at the time of death, he immediately became eligible"

Kaṁsa and Śiśupāla\nwere demons, but because they thought of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead throughout their lives and at the time of death, they were granted\nliberation by Kṛṣṇa Himself.\nOf course, it is best if one thinks of Kṛṣṇa favorably. Bhakti, or\ndevotional service, means thinking favorably of Kṛṣṇa. Śiśupāla and Kaṁsa\nwere not devotees, because the word devotee implies someone who is\nfavorably disposed toward Kṛṣṇa. Thinking of Kṛṣṇa in the opposite way,\nhowever, is also accepted by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that anyone who\nthinks of Him always, even as an enemy, becomes the greatest yogī and\nattains liberation. Thus the results of yogic performances and austerities\nwere achieved even by such inimical personalities as Kaṁsa and Śiśupāla.\nIn the impersonal Brahman effulgence (brahmajyoti) we find not only the\nhighest learned scholars (jñānīs), who have struggled to attain Brahman, but\nalso those persons who constantly think of Kṛṣṇa in enmity. They also enter\ninto that spiritual effulgence. Thus the destination achieved by the jñānīs is\nalso achieved by the enemies of Kṛṣṇa. This, however, is not very desirable.\nA living entity can remain for some time in the Brahman effulgence\n(brahmajyoti) as a tiny shining spiritual particle. As there are many\nmolecular particles of sunshine, similarly the living entities can live as\nsmall particles of spiritual effulgence in the brahmajyoti.

By nature the living\nentities want varieties of sense enjoyment, but in that impersonal existence\nthere are no varieties of enjoyment. So when they desire to enjoy, they have\nto come again to this material world. Therefore, if one merges into the\nBrahman effulgence, there is every chance of falling down.\nKṛṣṇa's devotees do not desire liberation, because their only interest is to\nbe engaged in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, whether in the material world or\nin the spiritual world.

While chanting the name of\nNārāyaṇa, Ajāmila was actually thinking of his son, but simply because\nthey heard Ajāmila chant the Lord's name, the Viṣṇudūtas immediately\ncame for Ajāmila's protection. Chanting of the Lord's holy name is actually\nmeant for His glorification.

Because Ajāmila had\nchanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa, the Viṣṇudūtas not only immediately\narrived on the spot but also at once ordered the Yamadūtas not to touch him.\nBy speaking with resounding voices, the Viṣṇudūtas threatened to punish\nthe Yamadūtas if they continued trying to snatch Ajāmila's soul from his\nheart. The order-carriers of Yamarāja have jurisdiction over all sinful living\nentities, but the messengers of Lord Viṣṇu are capable of punishing anyone,\nincluding Yamarāja, if he wrongs a Vaiṣṇava.\nModern scientists do not know where to find the soul within the body\nwith their material instruments, but here the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam clearly\nexplains that the soul is within the core of the heart (hṛdaya); it is from the\nheart that the Yamadūtas were trying to extract the soul of Ajāmila.

Now, sirs, why are you obstructing us?\" (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n6.1.32–36)\nDivine Interference\nThe sins Ajāmila had committed placed him within the jurisdiction of\nYamarāja, the supreme judge appointed to consider the sins of the living\nentities. When forbidden to touch Ajāmila, the order-carriers of Yamarāja\nwere surprised, because within all the three worlds no one had ever before\nhindered them in the execution of their duty.\nThe Viṣṇudūtas were coming from Vaikuṇṭha, and they appeared\nextraordinary, each with four arms.

One is then eligible to live in Vaikuṇṭha or\nKṛṣṇaloka. The word siddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a pure devotee of\nthe Lord.\nSince the Yamadūtas are servants of Yamarāja, who is also one of the\nsiddha-sattamas, they knew that a siddha-sattama is above the demigods\nand sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within this\nmaterial world. The Yamadūtas therefore inquired why the Viṣṇudūtas were\npreventing them from carrying out the orders of such an exalted soul as\nYamarāja.\nIt should also be noted that Ajāmila was not yet dead, for the Yamadūtas\nhad been stopped before they could snatch the soul from his heart. Ajāmila\nwas simply on the verge of death as the argument progressed between the\nYamadūtas and the Viṣṇudūtas. The conclusion of that argument was to be a\ndecision regarding who would claim the soul of Ajāmila.\nSpiritual Beauty\nThe Viṣṇudūtas exactly resembled Lord Viṣṇu.

They did not\nknow that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified\nby constantly chanting the holy name of Nārāyaṇa.\nThe Viṣṇudūtas were so effulgent because they were residents of the\nspiritual world, where everyone and everything is self-effulgent.

The residents of Vaikuṇṭha have the same bodily features as\nNārāyaṇa because they have attained the liberation of sārūpya, but they\nnevertheless act as servants. All the residents of Vaikuṇṭhaloka know\nperfectly well that their master is Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, and that they are all\nHis servants.

But\nthe spiritual world exists. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.20),\nparas tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo: \"Besides this inferior, material nature there is\nanother, superior nature.\" This material nature is one nature, comprised of\nmillions and trillions of universes clustered together in one corner of the\nspiritual sky. We cannot even measure the sky covered by this one universe,\nwithin which there are innumerable planets; yet there are millions and\ntrillions of universes in the entire material creation. And the entire material\ncreation is only one fourth of existence. In other words, this whole material\nworld is existing in one fourth of Kṛṣṇa's energy. The other three fourths\ncomprise the spiritual sky. Unfortunate persons think that this planet is all in\nall, but this is frog philosophy. A frog in a well cannot understand anything\nbeyond the well, and he measures everything in terms of his well. When he\nis told about the ocean, he cannot imagine it. Similarly, persons with such a\nfrog's mentality imagine, \"God is like this,\" or \"God's kingdom is like that,\"\nor \"I am God,\" or \"There is no God.\" But this is all foolishness."

The\ndevotees in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must therefore be fully\naware of the mission of Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya and the philosophy of\nKṛṣṇa consciousness; otherwise they will be considered foolish.\nLord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei 'guru'\nhaya: [Cc. Madhya 8.128] \"One must know Kṛṣṇa-then he can become a\nguru.\" Not just anyone can become a guru. Thus the Viṣṇudūtas challenged\nthe Yamadūtas: \"If you are truly representatives of Dharmarāja, then you\nmust explain what is religion and what is irreligion.\" That should be the\ncriterion for determining who is actually representative of religion. It is not\nthat everyone should be accepted as religious or as a guru. Widespread\nignorance has given rise to many persons calling themselves God,\nrepresenting so much nonsense in the name of dharma. When someone\nsays, \"I am God,\" or \"I have become God by mystic yoga,\" one should\nchallenge him. In America a man claimed, \"I am God, everyone is God,\"\nand thus gathered disciples. One day he was suffering from a toothache, and\nI asked him, \"What kind of God are you that you are suffering so much\nfrom a toothache?\" Only a lunatic or a cheater claims, \"I am God.\"\nOfficers of Law Enforcement"

There is no question of\njudging these liberated living beings. Only a small fraction of the living\nentities, perhaps one fourth, are in the material world. And the major\nportion of the living entities in the material world-8,000,000 of the\n8,400,000 forms of life-are lower than human beings. They are not\npunishable, for under the laws of material nature they are automatically\nevolving. Human beings, who are advanced in consciousness, are\nresponsible for their actions, but not all humans are punishable. Those\nengaged in advanced pious activities are beyond punishment. Only those\nwho engage in sinful activities are punishable. Therefore the Viṣṇudūtas\nparticularly inquired about the criteria Yamarāja uses to determine who is\npunishable and who is not. How is one to be judged? What is the basic\nprinciple of authority? These are the questions raised by the Viṣṇudūtas.\nThe Yamadūtas felt that they were faultless because they were following\nthe orders of Yamarāja, who himself is faultless. Just because a magistrate\nhas to direct the punishment of those who transgress the law does not mean\nthe magistrate is a criminal. He is a representative of the government.\nSimilarly, although Yamarāja has jurisdiction over the regions of hell and\ndeals with all sinful persons, he is a pure representative of Kṛṣṇa and simply\nexecutes the order of his master.\nA police constable is supposed to know the law and whom to arrest for\nbreaking the law. If he arrests anyone and everyone, then he himself is a\ncriminal. He may not arrest the law-abiding citizens. Similarly, the\nYamadūtas cannot take away just anyone and everyone to the court of\nYamarāja. They can take only the nondevotees to be punished for their\nsinful acts. Yamarāja has especially cautioned the Yamadūtas not to\napproach Vaiṣṇavas.\nHowever, because Ajāmila had been very sinful, the Yamadūtas could\nnot understand why he should not be considered a criminal and be brought\nto Yamarāja for punishment.\nDevotees and Demons\nThere are two classes of people in this material world: those who are\nservants of God, called devas or suras, and those who are servants of māyā"

A paid servant will serve in proportion to the money he\nreceives, but in Vaikuṇṭha there is no question of being a paid servant.\nEveryone is liberated, and everyone is as opulent as the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, but everyone is still a servant. In the material world\npeople serve out of need, but in the spiritual world everyone serves out of\nlove.

But such \"Gods\" must also follow the laws of\nGod in the form of birth, death, disease, and old age.\nOnly persons who are totally illusioned refuse to serve God.

Similarly, when a living entity is haunted by māyā, or\nengrossed by the illusory effects of the material nature, he also talks foolish\nnonsense, and the most foolish talk is to claim that he is God.\nAmong the two classes of men-the divine (devas) and the demoniac\n(asuras)-there is an ongoing struggle.

That is the nature of demons.\nOf course, even a tiger has affection for her cubs, and so at first\nHiraṇyakaśipu showed affection for Prahlāda Mahārāja, who was a very\nwell mannered and attractive child at five years old. One day Hiraṇyakaśipu\nasked his son, \"My dear boy, what is the best thing you have learned in\nschool? Tell me.\"\nPrahlāda Mahārāja replied, \"One should sacrifice everything to realize\nGod. This human form of life is the best opportunity we have for making\nspiritual progress, and it must be utilized for realizing God.\"\nHiraṇyakaśipu angrily inquired from his son's teachers, \"Why have you\ntaught all this nonsense to my boy?\""

For\nthose who indulge in sense gratification, Kṛṣṇa gives the facility, forcing\nthem to take birth again in the material atmosphere. A monkey has very\ngood facility for enjoying sex. In some ways a monkey is renounced: he\nlives naked in the forest, he eats only fruit. But his nature is that he must\nhave at least three dozen wives for sex enjoyment. So-called renunciants\nwho wear the cloth of a sādhu but secretly enjoy illicit sex with women are\njust like monkeys. This is demoniac.\nDemons, or asuras, do not believe in God and act according to their own\nwhims.

These\nauthorities know exactly who God is, and they can direct us to Him.\nTherefore the śāstras advise us to follow them.\nWithout following the mahājanas, it is impossible to know God, because\nwe cannot understand the path of religion by our mental speculation.\nReligious principles are enunciated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead\n(dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB 6.3.19]). Therefore real\nreligion means to abide by the words of the Supreme Lord and His\nrepresentatives. In the Bhagavad-gītā (18.66) Kṛṣṇa says, mām ekaṁ\nśaraṇaṁ vraja: \"Simply surrender unto Me.\" That is true religion. Anything\nelse is irreligion. Manmade religion is not religion; it is cheating.

The path of dharma is\nstrictly followed by the mahājanas, and so we have to follow them.\nOtherwise there is no possibility of understanding what religion is or who\nGod is.\nEveryone in the material world is puzzled about what religion is.\nTherefore, the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (1.2.12) says, one should approach a\nguru: tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet [MU 1.2.12]. \"If someone\nwants to learn the transcendental science, he has to approach a guru.\" There\nare no exceptions.

And there are\nthree principles to observe in taking shelter of a guru: tad viddhi\npraṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā [Bg. 4.34]. We must surrender to the\nspiritual master, we must inquire from him, and we must render service to\nhim. Then we will be able to understand real spiritual knowledge."

Even in this life we do not remember that we were once\nbabies on the laps of our mothers. So many things have happened in our\nlifetime, but we do not remember them all. If we cannot even remember\nthings that have happened in this life, how can we remember our last life?\nA person engages in sinful activities because he does not know what he\ndid in his past life to get his present materially conditioned body, which is\nsubjected to the threefold miseries-those produced by his own body and\nmind, those caused by other living entities, and those arising from natural\ndisasters. As stated by Lord Ṛṣabhadeva in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (5.5.4),\nnūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti: a human\nbeing who is mad after sense gratification does not hesitate to act sinfully.\nNa sādhu manye: this is not good. Yata ātmano 'yam asann api kleśada āsa\ndehaḥ: because of such sinful actions, one receives another body in which\nto suffer as he is suffering in his present body because of his past sinful\nactivities.\nA person who does not have Vedic knowledge always acts in ignorance\nof what he has done in the past, what he is doing at the present, and how he\nwill suffer in the future. He is completely in darkness. Therefore the Vedic\ninjunction is tamasi mā: \"Don't remain in darkness.\" Jyotir gama: \"Try to\ngo to the light.\" This light is Vedic knowledge, which one can understand\nwhen one is elevated to the mode of goodness or when one transcends the\nmode of goodness by engaging in devotional service to the spiritual master\nand the Supreme Lord.\nKnowledge through Service"

When the Vedic\nknowledge is revealed, one need no longer remain in the darkness of\nmaterial nature.\nAccording to his association with the material modes of nature-\ngoodness, passion, and ignorance-a living entity gets a particular type of\nbody. The example of one who associates with the mode of goodness is a\nqualified brāhmaṇa. Such a brāhmaṇa knows past, present, and future\nbecause he consults the Vedic literature and sees through the eyes of\nscripture (śāstra-cakṣuḥ). He can understand what his past life was, why he\nis in the present body, and how he can obtain liberation from the clutches of\nmāyā and not accept another material body.

The living entities are thus\nknown as peaceful, restless, and foolish; as happy, unhappy, or in-between; or as religious,\nirreligious, and semireligious. We can deduce that in the next life these three kinds of material\nnature will similarly act. Just as springtime in the present indicates the nature of springtimes in\nthe past and future, so this life of happiness, distress, or a mixture of both gives evidence\nconcerning the religious and irreligious activities of one's past and future lives.\n\"The omnipotent Yamarāja is as good as Lord Brahmā, for while situated in his own abode and\nin everyone's heart like the Paramātmā, he mentally observes the past activities of a living\nentity and thus understands how the living entity will act in future lives.\n\"As a sleeping person acts according to the body manifested in his dreams and accepts it to be\nhimself, so one identifies with his present body, which he acquired because of his past religious\nor irreligious actions, and is unable to know his past or future lives.\" (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n6.1.46–49)\nBreaking Free of Past, Present, and Future Karma\nHere the Yamadūtas point out that the actions and reactions of the three\nmodes of material nature are visible in this life. For example, some people\nare very happy, some are very distressed, and some are in mixed happiness\nand distress. This is the result of past association with the modes of material\nnature-goodness, passion, and ignorance. Since these varieties are visible in\nthis life, we may assume that the living entities, according to their\nassociation with the different modes of material nature, will be happy,\ndistressed, or between the two in their next lives also. Therefore the best\npolicy is to disassociate oneself from the three modes of material nature and\nbe always transcendental to their contamination. This is possible only when\none fully engages in the devotional service of the Lord, as Kṛṣṇa confirms\nin the Bhagavad-gītā (14.26):\nmāṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa\nbhakti-yogena sevate\nsa guṇān samatītyaitān\nbrahma-bhūyāya kalpate"

Thus at death each\nbeing is awarded a particular body in a particular place, according to his\nwork. As Lord Kapila explains in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.31.1),\nkarmaṇā daiva-netreṇa\njantur dehopapattaye\nstriyāḥ praviṣta udaraṁ\npuṁso retaḥ-kaṇāśrayaḥ\n\"Under the supervision of the Supreme Lord and according to the result of\nhis work, the living entity, the soul, is made to enter the womb of a woman\nthrough the particle of male semen to assume a particular type of body.\"\nWe are changing our bodies every day, at every moment. It is called\n\"growth,\" but actually it is a change of body. Growing means leaving the\nold body and accepting a new body. After some years we can see that a\nchild has grown to boyhood, then to youth. That means he has changed his\nbody. Similarly, when we find that the body is no longer inhabitable, we\nhave to give it up and accept another body, just as we have to give up our\nclothes when they become old and worn.\nThis change is executed under the supervision of higher authorities\n(daiva-netreṇa). According to one's religious and irreligious acts, one has to\naccept a particular type of body in a particular position and suffer. Our\nsufferings are classified as ādhibhautika, ādhyātmika, and ādhidaivika.\nĀdhyātmika miseries are those caused by our own bodies and minds,\nādhibhautika miseries are those inflicted by other living entities, and\nādhidaivika miseries are those which are inflicted by higher authorities\n(devas) and which are completely beyond our control-such as earthquake,\ndrought, flood, and famine.

It is very difficult to exactly pinpoint the origin of this\nforgetfulness. But even though we have forgotten Him since time\nimmemorial, Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that to remind us of our spiritual identity\nand our oneness with Him as His parts, He comes personally and teaches us\nwhat we have forgotten. And when He departs He leaves behind the\nscripture, especially the Bhagavad-gītā, where He requests, sarva-dharmān\nparityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja: \"Please give up all your nonsense and\nsurrender unto Me. I shall give you all protection.\" (Bhagavad-gītā 18.66)\nKṛṣṇa is the father of all living entities. He is not happy that all these\nsouls in the material world are rotting like hogs. Therefore He sends His\nrepresentatives. In the case of Lord Jesus Christ, Kṛṣṇa sent His son. Lord\nJesus claimed to be the son of God. Everyone is a son of God, but this son\nwas an especially favorite son, and he was sent to a particular place to\nreclaim the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead.\nBut if the conditioned souls insist on staying here, what can Kṛṣṇa or His\nservant do? They allow us to go on with our materialistic activities, because\nthe first condition for getting out of the material prison house is that we\nmust desire to get out. When we finally become disgusted with our\npredicament, we pray, \"My dear Lord, I have served lust, anger, and greed\nfor so long, but they are still unsatisfied, and now I have become disgusted\nwith serving them. Now, my dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, my intelligence is awakened,\nand I have come to You. Please engage me in Your service.\"\nThe living entity is the marginal energy (tataṣṭha-śakti) of the Lord,\nwhich means he can choose to be controlled by Kṛṣṇa's inferior, material\nenergy or His superior, spiritual energy. We devotees have chosen to come\nto Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In other words, we have agreed to surrender to\nKṛṣṇa and submit to the protection of His internal, spiritual energy.\nSurrender to Kṛṣṇa begins with chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra: Hare\nKṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma"

We must hear from the\nsuperior authority. At night we sleep peacefully, unaware that someone\nmight be coming to chop off our head. However, our sense of hearing is\nacute, even in the sleeping state. If someone cries out, \"Wake up! Wake up!\nSomeone is coming to kill you!\" we can be saved. Similarly, we are\nsleeping under the influence of material nature. We seem to be awake and\nacting, but prakṛti (material nature) is doing the acting-not us. We are being\nforced to act according to our association with the different modes of\nmaterial nature. Although we are in the sleeping condition, our ear does not\nsleep, and it helps us to rise out of ignorance.

Above the mind is the\nseventeenth element, the soul, the living being himself, who, in cooperation with the other\nsixteen, enjoys the material world alone. The living being experiences three kinds of situations,\nnamely happy, distressful, and mixed.\n\"The subtle body is endowed with sixteen parts-the five knowledge-acquiring senses, the five\nworking senses, the five objects of sense gratification, and the mind. This subtle body is an\neffect of the three modes of material nature. It is composed of insurmountably strong desires,\nand therefore it causes the living entity to transmigrate from one body to another in human life,\nanimal life, and life as a demigod. When the living entity gets the body of a demigod, he is\ncertainly very jubilant, when he gets a human body he is always in lamentation, and when he\ngets the body of an animal he is always afraid. In all conditions, however, he is actually\nmiserable. His miserable condition is called saṁsṛti, or transmigration in material life.\n\"The foolish embodied living entity, inept at controlling his senses and mind, is forced to act\naccording to the influence of the modes of material nature, even against his desires. He is like a\nsilkworm that uses its own saliva to create a cocoon and then becomes trapped in it, with no\npossibility of getting out. The living entity traps himself in a network of his own fruitive\nactivities and then can find no way to release himself. Thus he is always bewildered, and\nrepeatedly he dies.\n\"No living entity can remain unengaged, even for a moment. One must act by his natural\ntendency according to the three modes of material nature because this tendency forcibly makes\nhim work in a particular way. The fruitive acts a living being performs, whether pious or\nimpious, are the unseen cause for the fulfillment of his desires. This unseen cause is the root of\nthe living entity's different bodies. Because of his intense desire, the living entity takes birth in a\nparticular family and receives a body like his mother's or father's body. Thus the gross and\nsubtle bodies are created according to his desire.\n\"Since the living entity is associated with material nature, he is in an awkward position, but if\nin the human form of life he is taught how to associate with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead or His devotee, this position can be overcome.\" (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.50–55)\nThe Demands of the Senses\nThese verses describe how the living entity becomes entangled in the\nmaterial body due to the interaction of the material modes of nature.\nEveryone engages in work with his hands, legs, and other senses just to\nachieve a certain goal according to his concocted ideas. In this way one tries\nto enjoy the five sense objects, namely form, sound, taste, aroma, and touch,\nnot knowing that the actual goal of life is to satisfy the Supreme Lord."

Nevertheless, the Supreme Lord is so kind that He comes Himself\nto instruct the bewildered living entity how to act obediently and then\ngradually return home, back to Godhead, where he can attain an eternal,\npeaceful life of bliss and knowledge.\nIn the material world the living entity has a body that is a very\ncomplicated combination of the material elements, and with this body he\nstruggles alone, as indicated in verse 50 by the words ekas tu. For example,\nif one is struggling in the ocean, he must swim through it alone. Although\nmany other men and aquatics are swimming in the ocean, he must take care\nof himself, because no one else will help him. Therefore this verse indicates\nthat the seventeenth item, the soul, must work alone. Although he tries to\ncreate society, friendship, and love, ultimately no one can help him but\nKṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord. Therefore his only concern should be how to\nsatisfy Kṛṣṇa-how to surrender to Him and evoke His mercy. That is also\nwhat Kṛṣṇa wants. As He says in the Bhagavad-gītā (18.66), sarva-\ndharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja: \"Just give up all kinds of\nconcocted religion and surrender to Me.\"\nPeople bewildered by material conditions try to be united, but although\nthey strive for unity among men and nations, all their attempts are futile.\nEveryone must struggle alone for existence with the many elements of\nnature.

If an individual becomes a pure\ndevotee of Kṛṣṇa, he is then delivered from the ocean of nescience. Thus his\nlife becomes successful.\nPain and Pleasure\nActually, there is no pleasure in the material world; everything is painful.\nEveryone is trying to be happy by sensual activity, but the result is\nunhappiness and frustration. This is called māyā, illusion.\nLord Buddha understood the nature of material pleasure. In his youth he\nwas a prince, enjoying great opulence and sensual pleasures, but he\nrenounced it all. Sitting down in meditation, he stopped all sensual\nactivities, which subject one to the pains and pleasures of this material\nworld. He gave up his kingdom just to teach that sensual activities do not\nhelp us attain salvation. Salvation means to get out of the clutches of the\npleasure and pain of this world.\nBuddhism is concerned largely with the predicament of the body. Due to\nthe interactions of the three modes of material nature, which are acting on\nour material bodies, we experience various pains and pleasures. Buddhism\nteaches that one can be relieved of these pains and pleasures as soon as one\ndismantles the combination of the material elements in the shape of the\nphysical body. Nirvāṇa, the goal of Buddhism, is the state attained when a\nperson has finished with the material combinations. After all, pains and\npleasures are due to possessing this material body. However, Buddhist\nphilosophy does not provide information about the soul, the possessor of the\nbody. Thus Buddhism is imperfect.\nBuddhist philosophy is incomplete, but that does not mean Lord Buddha\ndid not know the complete truth. A teacher may have received his Masters\ndegree, yet he still teaches the ABC's to his students. It is not that his\nknowledge is limited to the ABC's.

The teacher holds his Masters degree, but\nthe students may not be qualified to receive the high instructions that the\nteacher is competent to teach.\nTherefore there are different schools of religion, like Buddhism and\nŚaṅkarācārya's Māyāvāda philosophy. Both the Buddhists and the\nMāyāvādīs encourage their followers to try to get free of pain and pleasure,\nwhich are due to sensual activities. No genuine philosopher urges his\nfollowers to pursue sensual activities. Buddha finishes with matter: to\nachieve nirvāṇa one must first dismantle the material combination of the\nbody. In other words, the body is a combination of five material elements:\nearth, water, fire, air, and ether, and this combination is the cause of all pain\nand pleasure; so when the combination is at last dismantled, there will be no\nmore pain and pleasure.\nŚaṅkarācārya's philosophy is to get out of this combination of material\nelements and become situated in our original, spiritual position. Thus the\nMāyāvādīs' motto is brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā: \"Brahman, the Absolute,\nis true, and this material creation is false.\" Śaṅkarācārya rejected Buddha's\nphilosophy, which gives no information concerning the spirit soul. Buddha's\nphilosophy deals only with matter and the dissolution of matter; thus the\ngoal of Buddhism is to merge into the voidness.\nBoth Buddhism and Māyāvāda philosophy reveal only partial truth.\nŚaṅkarācārya's Māyāvāda philosophy accepts Brahman, spirit, but does not\ndescribe spirit in its fullness. Māyāvāda philosophy teaches that as soon as\nwe become cognizant of our existence as Brahman (ahaṁ brahmāsmi), then\nall our activities come to a stop. But this is not a fact. The living entity is\nalways active. It may seem that in meditation one can stop all sensual\nactivity, but still one is meditating, and that is also action.\nWhile meditating on Brahman, the Māyāvādī thinks, \"I have become\nGod.\" In one sense, of course, it is correct to think, \"I am one with God,\"\nfor as spirit souls we are all one with God in quality. But no one can ever\nbecome quantitatively one with God. In the Bhagavad-gītā (15.7) Kṛṣṇa\ndeclares that the living entities are \"part and parcel of Me.\" Kṛṣṇa is\ncompletely spiritual (sac-cid-ānanda), so each particle of spirit must also be\nsac-cid-ānanda, just as a gold earring is qualitatively one with the gold in a\ngold mine. Still, the gold earring is not the gold mine."

We cannot become Lord Nārāyaṇa.\nNārāyaṇa is vibhu, which means \"very big\" or \"infinite,\" whereas we are\naṇu, infinitesimal. Our spiritual magnitude measures one ten-thousandth of\nthe tip of a hair. Therefore how can any sane man claim that he has become\nGod?\nŚaṅkarācārya gave a hint about Brahman, teaching everyone to think,\nahaṁ brahmāsmi, \"I am the spirit self, not the material body.\" The Vedas\nagree. One who is situated in mukti, or liberation, understands perfectly, \"I\nam not this body; I am pure spirit soul.\" But that is not the end of self-\nrealization. Next one has to ask, \"If I am an eternal spirit soul, what is my\neternal spiritual activity?\" That eternal activity is devotional service to\nKṛṣṇa.\nIn the Bhagavad-gītā (18.54) Lord Kṛṣṇa describes how Brahman\nrealization leads to devotional service:\nbrahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā\nna śocati na kāṅkṣati\nsamaḥ sarveṣu bhūtesu\nmad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme\nBrahman and becomes fully joyful.

They involve\nthemselves in humanitarian activities, thinking, \"My fellow countrymen are\nsuffering; let me open a hospital\" or \"They are uneducated; let me open a\nschool.\" If someone is really on the platform of brahma-bhūtaḥ, why would\nhe accept any particular place as his country?

At present, our mind and senses are absorbed in bodily designations,\nsuch as \"I am American,\" \"I am Indian,\" or \"I am English.\" In this\nconsciousness we think that we should apply our senses in the service of\nour relatives, our society, our nation, etc. But these are temporary\ncircumstances. Our real position is that we are Brahman, pure spirit soul. As\nlong as we think of ourselves as belonging to some temporary designation,\nwe cannot become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa.\nAs we have pointed out, Brahman realization is not the end of spiritual\nknowledge. There are three stages of self-realization: Brahman, or the\nrealization that one is not this body but a spirit soul; Paramātmā realization,\nor understanding the Lord within the heart; and Bhagavān realization,\nrealizing the Lord in His personal form as Śrī Kṛṣṇa.\nBeyond Brahman is Paramātmā realization, realizing Kṛṣṇa in the heart\nas Supersoul. Brahman is like the sunlight, but Paramātmā realization is like\nseeing the sun globe itself, the source of the sun's rays. Going still further,\none can enter into the spiritual planets of Vaikuṇṭha and see the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead face to face. This is the ultimate stage of self-\nrealization and is like meeting the sun-god himself. The sunlight, the sun\nglobe, and the sun-god are one and inseparable, yet they are simultaneously\ndifferent. The sunlight is the impersonal effulgence of the sun, the sun globe\nis its localized aspect, and the sun-god is the personal source of both the sun\nglobe and the sunlight.

Only when a person fully\nunderstands that he is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa and he acts on that\nunderstanding is he truly self-realized.\nA Special Concession for All People\nIn the present age, for all people the best path to achieve self-realization\nis to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa\nKṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. The\nconditioned souls in this Age of Kali are so engrossed in sinful activities\nthat it is impossible for them to follow the Vedic injunctions in a systematic\nway. The chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra is the special concession\nof Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu-Kṛṣṇa Himself-who appeared five hundred\nyears ago just to deliver the fallen souls by inaugurating the saṅkīrtana\nmovement, the movement of the congregational chanting of the Lord's holy\nnames. Lord Caitanya would often quote the following verse from the\nBṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa (3.8.126):\nharer nāma harer nāma\nharer nāmaiva kevalam\nkalau nāsty eva nāsty eva\nnāsty eva gatir anyathā\n[Adi 17.21]"

In this movement all kinds of sinful\nactivities are being given up by persons who have been addicted to bad\nhabits ever since they were living in the wombs of their mothers. This is\ntheir good fortune. As Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says in the Caitanya-\ncaritāmṛta (Madhya-līlā 19.151),\nbrahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva\nguru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja\n\"The living entity is rotating in different lives and in different bodies,\ntransmigrating from one situation to another throughout the universe, but if\nhe is fortunate and gets the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, he will get a bona fide spiritual\nmaster, from whom he will receive the seed of the creeper of bhakti,\ndevotional service.\" If he is truly intelligent, he will sow that seed in his\nheart and water it. If you sow a seed in the earth, you must water it so that it\nwill fructify. Similarly, once the seed of bhakti has been sown in the heart, it\nhas to be watered properly. What is that water? Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam: hearing\nand chanting the glories of Kṛṣṇa is the watering process that will make the\nseed of devotional service grow.\nBy cultivating devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, we can get out of our\nunfortunate position in the material world, which Kṛṣṇa has certified in the\nBhagavad-gītā as duḥkhālayam, a place full of miseries. In other words, by\ntaking shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa in the shape of chanting and hearing\nHis holy name, we will not have to undergo repeated birth and death in this\nmiserable material world.\nBody of Desire\nThe Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam describes in detail how a conditioned living\nentity takes birth. According to his karma, the living entity is put into the\nsemen of a particular father, and the living entity's gross material body is\nmanifested from the union of father and mother. During sexual intercourse,\nthe mentalities of the father and mother are combined when the father's\nsemen and mother's egg mix, and this combination is acquired by the child."

According to one's previous activities, one develops a certain kind\nof subtle body-made up of mind, intelligence, and false ego-and on the basis\nof the subtle body one gets a particular gross body. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in\nthe Bhagavad-gītā (8.6):\nyaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ\ntyajaty ante kalevaram\ntaṁ tam evaiti kaunteya\nsadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ\n\"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of\nKuntī, that state he will attain without fail.\" The character of the subtle body\nat the time of death is determined by the sum total of one's activities during\none's lifetime. If a human being is taught to change his subtle body by\ndeveloping Kṛṣṇa consciousness, at the time of death his subtle body will\ncreate a gross body in which he will be a devotee of Kṛṣṇa-or if he is still\nmore advanced, he will not take another material body at all but will\nimmediately get a spiritual body and thus return home, back to Godhead.\nThis is the perfection of human life."

Furthermore, he was always truthful, he knew how to\nchant the Vedic mantras, and he was also very pure. Ajāmila was very respectful to his spiritual\nmaster, the fire-god, guests, and the elders of his household. Indeed, he was free from false\nprestige. He was upright, benevolent to all living entities, and well behaved. He would never\nspeak nonsense or envy anyone.\n\"Once Ajāmila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers, and\ntwo kinds of grass, called samit and kuśa. On the way home he came upon a lusty fourth-class\nman (śūdra) shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The śūdra was smiling, singing,\nand enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the śūdra and the prostitute were drunk. The\nprostitute's eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the\ncondition in which Ajāmila saw them.\n\"The śūdra, his arm decorated with turmeric powder, was embracing the prostitute. When\nAjāmila saw her, the dormant lusty desires in his heart awakened, and in illusion he fell under\ntheir control. As far as possible he patiently tried to remember the instructions of the śāstras\nnot even to see a woman. With the help of this knowledge and his intellect, he tried to control\nhis lusty desires, but because of the force of Cupid within his heart, he failed to control his\nmind.\" (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.56–62)\nBrahminical Qualifications\nThe order-carriers of Yamarāja, the Yamadūtas, are explaining the factual\nposition of piety and impiety and how a living entity is entangled in this\nmaterial world.

In fact, he had all\ngood qualities. In other words, he was a perfect brāhmaṇa.

Śruta means that by hearing the Vedas, Ajāmila was rich\nin Vedic knowledge. In India brāhmaṇas are called paṇḍitas, \"learned\nmen.\" A brāhmaṇa cannot be a fool and a rascal. Therefore one who has no\nknowledge of the Vedas cannot be a brāhmaṇa. Simply reading the Vedas\nfrom a scholastic viewpoint is useless. One must practically apply the\nknowledge of the Vedas. Armchair Vedāntists smoke cigarettes while\nreading Vedānta, but that kind of study is useless. We have seen many so-\ncalled sannyāsīs talking on Vedānta, smoking all the while. Ajāmila was not\nthat type. He was a scholar of Vedic literature, and he was very well\nbehaved. A brāhmaṇa must study the Vedas under the guidance of a\nspiritual master, and after the purificatory process of upanāyana-saṁskāra,\nhe becomes dvija, or twice-born. At that time the sacred thread is offered to\nsuch a person. This is the sign by which we can understand a person has\nformally accepted a spiritual master. It is a kind of badge.\nOne who is not twice-born is unqualified to understand the Vedas. It is\nnot that just because one happens to know a little Sanskrit he becomes\nexpert in Vedic knowledge. Many foreign scholars have translated the\nVedas, but we do not accept their translations as bona fide, because a\nstudent of the Vedas must be dvija. When a person has become truthful, able\nto control his mind and senses, clean, simple and tolerant, full of\nknowledge, and able to practically apply knowledge in life, and when he\nhas full faith in God, Kṛṣṇa, he is dvija. Such a person can be said to have\nbecome a duly qualified brāhmaṇa, and he is able to study and understand\nthe Vedas.\nAjāmila was not only born in a brāhmaṇa family, but he was qualified in\nVedic knowledge. In his youth he studied the Vedas completely. He was\nśīlavān, \"very gentle.\" He was also sad-ācāra, which means he observed\nthe habit of keeping clean and rising early in the morning to attend Vedic\ntemple ceremonies, such as maṅgala-ārati. He was a reservoir of good\nqualities. We too can be sad-ācāra if we practice devotional service\nregularly, including daily attendance at maṅgala-ārati and chanting sixteen"

Even the six Gosvāmīs of\nVṛndāvana, who were liberated personalities, regularly chanted the mahā-\nmantra many times daily, and they never failed to offer their obeisances to\nthe Deity and the devotees. Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī would offer\nobeisances flat on the ground (daṇḍavats) many times daily. These\nactivities indicate that the Gosvāmīs were dhṛta-vrata, accustomed to taking\nvows with great determination and carrying them out. Without practicing\nausterity and penance with firm determination, we cannot approach God.\nOne who is serious about making spiritual advancement has to accept all\nthese regulative principles.\nAjāmila possessed all brahminical qualifications, and he knew all the\nnecessary mantras, such as the Gāyatrī mantra and the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-\nmantra. Also, he was always rendering service to his guru. That is the first\nqualification of a brāhmaṇa. In Vedic times, every high-caste family\nperformed a fire sacrifice in the morning after taking a bath and chanting\nVedic mantras. Agni (the sacrificial fire) was continually lit. They offered\noblations to the fire, to the guru, and then to all the adult members of the\nfamily. Thus they daily offered respect to their father and mother and to the\nspiritual master. Nowadays this is not done, but in the Vedic system this was\nthe first business of the day.\nA good example of this practice of respecting elders is Yudhiṣṭhira\nMahārāja, the great saintly Pāṇḍava king. After the battle of Kurukṣetra,\nYudhiṣṭhira and his four brothers would go every day to offer their respects\nto their paternal uncle, Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Dhṛtarāṣṭra had contrived many plots to\ndestroy the Pāṇḍavas, finally declaring war on them, but the result was that\nevery one of his hundred sons died. Even after he lost the war, he still\nrefused to welcome his nephews, the sons of his brother Pāṇḍu. This was a\ngreat insult to King Yudhiṣṭhira. One day Dhṛtarāṣṭra's younger brother,\nVidura, a great Vaiṣṇava, went to Dhṛtarāṣṭra and said, \"My dear brother,\nyou are so shameless that first you declare war against the Pāṇḍavas, and\nnow that you are an old man, still you do not receive King Yudhiṣṭhira as\nyour guest, yet you live in his house at his expense. Are you so shameless,"

Dhṛtarāṣṭra was an old man, and all his sons\nwere dead, but still he sat in his household arrangement, eating nicely\nprepared food. From this we can understand that family attachment is very\nstrong. Vidura chastised Dhṛtarāṣṭra: \"You are coughing up mucus because\nyou are very old, and your liver is weak. You will die very soon, yet you are\nstill sitting in your comfortable chair, just like a dog. Have you no more\nshame than a dog, which always sits waiting for his master to feed him?\"\nUpon hearing Vidura's harsh words, Dhṛtarāṣṭra's hard heart softened,\nand he replied,\"Yes! My dear brother Vidura, please let me know what I\nshould do.\"\nVidura said, \"Come with me immediately to the forest. For the remaining\ndays of your life, just engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Come with\nme.\" So without telling anyone, Dhṛtarāṣṭra left with Vidura, and Gāndhārī,\nDhṛtarāṣṭra's faithful wife, followed. Together they went to the forest to\nfinish their life in meditation on the Lord.\nWhen King Yudhiṣṭhira came to offer his obeisances in the morning and\nsaw that his uncles were not there, he became anxious, considering that\nDhṛtarāṣṭra was an old man. At that time the great sage Nārada Muni\nappeared and informed him, \"Do not worry. Dhṛtarāṣṭra and his wife,\nGāndhārī, have been brought to the forest by your uncle Vidura.\"\nThis story from the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam illustrates the system of\noffering respects to the elderly members of the family. After the morning's\nduties are performed, next one must go and offer obeisances to the spiritual\nmaster and the elderly persons in the family. One must also offer respects to\na guest. Usually we know when a certain guest is coming to our home and\ncan make preparations beforehand, but sometimes it happens that someone\ncomes unexpectedly, and he too must be received with respect. And when it\ncomes to eating, the head of the family should feed the older members first,\nthen his children and other members of the family. He will eat last, and\nbefore he eats his food he should stand in the road and call out, \"If anyone\nis hungry, please come. I still have not taken my food, and you are\nwelcome!\" Some remnants of food should be kept at home in anticipation\nof unexpected guests. The Vedic principle is that when someone comes and\nbegs, \"Sir, I am hungry,\" a man must give the hungry guest his own food"

So a young man will show\nconsideration even to an older stranger, what to speak of his father or elder\nbrother. In Vedic society, any older man is offered respect. These principles\nare not hard and fast, but this is Vedic custom.\nThus Ajāmila was trained in his youth to offer respect to the spiritual\nmaster and his elders. This is one of the symptoms of sad-ācāra. Gentleness\nis another symptom. In other words, he was friendly to all living beings. A\nreal brāhmaṇa is the friend of everyone, even an ant.\nIn this regard there is a story about Nārada Muni and a hunter. Once\nNārada Muni was passing through a forest near Prayag and saw that many\nanimals were lying half-dead. Feeling compassion for the suffering\ncreatures, he cried out, \"Who is the culprit who is killing these animals,\nleaving them to die in this way?\"\nThe barbaric hunter Mṛgāri answered, \"Dear sage, please let me do my\nbusiness.

Someone brought rice,\nsomeone brought dāl, and someone else brought fruit. The food began to\npile up.\nThe hunter Mṛgāri wondered, \"Why is Nārada Muni sending me so much\nfood? I have only myself and my wife to maintain.\" Thus he began\ndistributing the food. Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and distributing prasādam daily,\nhe became a perfect Vaiṣṇava. (This is the system introduced in this Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness movement-chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra and\ndistributing prasādam. In every temple of Kṛṣṇa we do this.)\nAfter some time, Nārada Muni called upon his friend Pārvata Muni and\nsaid, \"I have a very nice disciple who was a hunter. Let us go and see how\nhe is doing.\" Pārvata Muni agreed. When the two sages approached\nMṛgāri's house, they saw that he was jumping this way and that. Upon\nseeing Nārada Muni, he prepared to offer obeisances at his feet, but before\nhe did so he took the edge of his dhotī and gently brushed away the ants\ncrawling on the ground so as not to crush them. He had been jumping\nbecause he was trying to avoid stepping on the ants. This was the very man\nwho a short time before had been tormenting all kinds of animals, yet now\nhe was not prepared to kill even an ant. That is the nature of a Vaiṣṇava.\nSo, Ajāmila had this quality of gentleness, which is prominent in\nbrāhmaṇas. Also, despite all his training, Ajāmila was not proud. He was\nfree of ahaṅkāra, or false ego. The very word ahaṅkāra means \"I am doing\nthis, I am doing that, and therefore I have become so big.\" Ajāmila was free\nof this attitude. Nor was he envious. In these degraded times, everyone is\nenvious of one or more persons. But brāhmaṇas like Ajāmila are free of this\npropensity.

In\nthe present Age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for\npeople all over the world have become shameless. Long ago, when Ajāmila\nsaw the scene of the drunken śūdra and the prostitute, he was affected,\nalthough up until then he had been a perfect brahmacārī. Nowadays\npromiscuity is visible in so many places, and we must consider the position\nof a brahmacārī student who sees such behavior. For such a brahmacārī to\nremain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the\nregulative principles. Nevertheless, one who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness\nvery seriously can withstand the provocation of sin.\nIn our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex,\nintoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunken, half-\nnaked woman embracing a drunken man is a very common sight, especially\nin the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is\nvery difficult. Nevertheless, if by the grace of Kṛṣṇa a man adheres to the\nregulative principles and chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, Kṛṣṇa will\ncertainly protect him. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa says that His devotee is never\nvanquished (kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati). Therefore all\nthe disciples practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness should obediently follow the\nregulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy name of the\nLord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one's position is very\ndangerous.\nAjāmila had vowed to follow the regulative principles of spiritual life.\nBut as we see, even when one is highly qualified there is the chance of a\nfall. Seeing the low-class couple engaged in public sex proved to be his\ndownfall. Everyone knows that a husband and wife have sexual intercourse,\nbut this should be done privately. Sex in public is animalistic. Similarly, sex\nwith many partners is illicit. Nowadays illicit sex is common throughout the\nworld, especially in the Western countries. A young girl thinks, \"I will find\na suitable man, attract him, and have sex, but I won't marry him right away.\nI will test this man, then that man. When I have found the one who makes\nme happy, then I will marry.\" This is the mentality of a prostitute. And\nsimilarly, the young boys are hunting for many sex partners. These are"

There cannot be peace unless the\nwhole social structure is reformed, and that can be done only by Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness.\nKṛṣṇa consciousness is cultivated by good association, just as a degraded\nmentality is a result of bad association. As Lord Ṛṣabhadeva says in the\nŚrīmad-Bhāgavatam (5.5. 2), mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes tamo-\ndvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgi-saṅgam: \"If we want to open the door to liberation,\nwe should engage ourselves in the service of the mahātmās, the pure\ndevotees, but if we want to open the door to hellish life, then we can\nassociate with those who are very attached to women.\" The lusty people of\ntoday's so-called civilized society do not care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nThey do not care for their elderly family members. They indulge in sex in\nthe street, on the beach, in the cinema. Sex is advertised constantly to attract\nthe attention of the people. In this way materialistic atheists add fuel to the\nfire of lust, and people are going to hell.\nSo, Ajāmila became degraded by seeing a low-class couple embracing.\nBecause both the śūdra and the prostitute were drunk, their eyes were\nrolling, and the prostitute's clothes were loose. Nowadays it has become\nfashionable to wear revealing clothing, but this practice is abominable. It\nsimply makes the body more attractive for sex indulgence. It is said that if\none's body is smeared with turmeric, it increases the lusty desires of the\nopposite sex. The word kāma-liptena indicates that the śūdra was decorated\nwith turmeric smeared on his body. Because the śūdra and the prostitute\nwere rascals, they were not ashamed. They exhibited themselves freely, not\ncaring for public criticism. They were laughing, smiling, singing, and\nembracing, and the young Ajāmila saw everything when he passed by on\nthe road.\nIn modern times sexual affairs of this kind are regularly shown in the\ncinema, and thus it is not hard to guess what kind of character is forming in\nthe young men and women of today.

Just as the\nmaster is the enjoyer of his entire establishment, so Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer of\neverything and everyone in both the material and spiritual worlds. Actually,\nno one else is the enjoyer-no one else is in the position to enjoy. Kṛṣṇa is the\nonly enjoyer.\nWhen we forget our relationship with Kṛṣṇa as His eternal servitors, we\nbecome servants of our senses. Following the dictation of our senses, we\nenter into the darkest regions of illusion and are subjected to the punishment\nof Yamarāja. Sometimes our conscience forbids us, \"Don't do this,\" but we\nsurrender to our lust and greed, and thus we do it anyway. Kṛṣṇa is within\nour heart, also dictating \"Don't do it,\" yet still we do it. This kind of service\nto our senses simply brings suffering. Since we must serve, why not serve\nKṛṣṇa? Why should we serve our senses, which are never satisfied anyway?\nWe should become servants of God; that is the perfection of life. Otherwise\nwe shall be obliged to become servants of our senses and suffer.\nOne who becomes a servant of Kṛṣṇa becomes a gosvāmī, a master of his\nsenses. The title \"Gosvāmī\" indicates one who refuses to follow the\ndictations of his senses. Instead he follows the dictation of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead, just as Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī did.\n\"Gosvāmī\" is not a caste title. Before becoming a gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī\nserved the Mohammedan government as a minister and was consequently\nrejected by the Hindu brāhmaṇa society. But when he gave up the dictation"

But if one is unable\nto be a real vairāgī, then he must become a gṛhastha (householder). It is not\nthat one may pose himself as a brahmacārī or a sannyāsī and at the same\ntime indulge in illicit sex secretly. That is abominable. If a genuine\nhouseholder practices karma-yoga, giving the results of his activities to\nKṛṣṇa, he will eventually attain the platform of perfect renunciation. He\nshould not desire to enjoy the fruits of his activities but should instead work\nas a matter of duty, thinking \"Kṛṣṇa wants this-Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied by\nmy doing this-and therefore I must do it.\" This is the right attitude for a\ndevotee. Arjuna was unwilling to fight for his personal interest, but when he\nunderstood that Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight, he took it as his duty: \"It must\nbe done. It does not matter whether I like it or not. Kṛṣṇa wants it, and\ntherefore I must do it.\" That is the attitude of a renounced devotee of the\nLord.\nIn the Bhagavad-gītā (18.66) Lord Kṛṣṇa instructs His disciple Arjuna,\n\"Just surrender unto Me, and I shall protect you from all sinful reactions.\"\nAnd Arjuna accepts Kṛṣṇa's instruction with the words kariṣye vacanaṁ\ntava: \"I will do as You say.\" (Bhagavad-gītā 18.73) If we follow Arjuna's\nexample, we will be in direct contact with Kṛṣṇa, and we will be able to\nsurmount all difficulties in both our spiritual and material life. We hear the\ninstructions of Kṛṣṇa via the unbroken chain of disciplic succession (guru-\nparamparā). Acceptance of these instructions is called śikṣā, or voluntarily\nfollowing the instruction of the spiritual master. The independent nature of\nthe living entity is that he does not want to follow the instructions of\nanother living being, however pure. But when one voluntarily agrees to\nobey the orders of the spiritual master, one is following the orders of Kṛṣṇa,\nand thus one's life becomes perfect.\nIn the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (11.17.27) Kṛṣṇa says,\nācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān\nnāvamanyeta karhicit\nna martya-buddhyāsūyeta\nsarva-deva-mayo guruḥ"

One should not envy him, thinking him an ordinary man, for he is the\nrepresentative of all the demigods.\" Thinking the spiritual master an\nordinary person and envying him are causes of a devotee's falling down.\nDevotional service requires training under the guidance of a spiritual\nmaster, and this guidance is received when one surrenders to the spiritual\nmaster, inquires from him, and renders service to him. But these are\nimpossible for one who envies the spiritual master.\nRuined by a Prostitute . . . Saved by the Holy Name\nAjāmila was trained as a brāhmaṇa, but he lost his position as a\nbrāhmaṇa by associating with a prostitute, so much so that he forgot all his\nbrahminical activities. Nevertheless, at the end of his life, by chanting the\nfour syllables of the holy name Nārāyaṇa, he was saved from the gravest\ndanger of falling down. As Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā (2.40), svalpam\napy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt: \"Even a little devotional\nservice can save one from the greatest danger.\" Devotional service, which\nbegins with chanting the holy name of the Lord, is so powerful that even if\na person falls down from the exalted position of a brāhmaṇa through sexual\nindulgence, he can be saved from all calamities if he somehow or other\nchants the holy name of the Lord. This is the extraordinary power of the\nLord's holy name. Therefore in the Bhagavad-gītā it is advised that one not\nforget the chanting of the holy name even for a moment: satataṁ kīrtayanto\nmāṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. 9.14].\nThere are so many dangers in this material world that one may fall down\nfrom an exalted position at any time. Yet if one keeps himself always pure\nand steady by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, he will be safe\nwithout a doubt. Ajāmila did not do this, and therefore he lost all his\nbrahminical qualities by the association of a prostitute. Especially\nmentioned here is the effect of eating food prepared by a prostitute. Food\nprepared by an unclean, sinful woman is extremely infectious. Ajāmila ate\nsuch food, and therefore he became sinful.\nAlso mentioned here is Ajāmila's misuse of his inheritance. Customarily\neveryone is eligible to inherit his father's property, and Ajāmila also\ninherited the money of his father. But what did he do with the money?\nInstead of engaging the money in the service of Kṛṣṇa, he engaged it in the"

How did this happen?\nHe was victimized by the prostitute's dangerous, lustful glance.\nA chaste and faithful wife will give birth to good sons, who will then\noffer oblations to their forefathers and thus deliver them if by chance they\nhave fallen into a hellish condition. The very word putra (\"son\") means\n\"one who can deliver his forefathers from hell.\" Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu\nshowed this by His example when He went to Gayā to offer oblations to His\nforefathers. Even today there is a Viṣṇu temple in Gayā where such\noblations are offered at the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. There have been cases\nwhere one's father or mother took the body of a ghost at death, and after\noblations were offered at the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu at Gayā, the father or\nmother was delivered. However, anyone who becomes a Vaiṣṇava offers\noblations to Viṣṇu at every moment, and thus his forefathers are\nautomatically delivered. If one son in the family becomes a Vaiṣṇava, he\ncan deliver fourteen generations of ancestors and fourteen generations of\nyet unborn descendants. This is confirmed in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.\nAs sense control is the beginning of pious life, illicit sex is the beginning\nof sinful life. One should not engage in illicit sex, or sex for any reason\nexcept having a child with one's wife. Marriage is meant for begetting\nchildren, and in that sense it is a religious institution. Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms\nthis in the Bhagavad-gītā (7.11): dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kāmo 'smi. \"I am\nsex that does not contradict religious principles.\" Caitanya Mahāprabhu had\na devotee named Śivānanda Sena, who was a family man. Śivānanda used\nto come with all the devotees every year to see Lord Caitanya in Purī, and\nhe came together with his wife and children. Once he came to see the Lord,\nand his wife offered her respects. At that time she was pregnant, so\nCaitanya Mahāprabhu advised Śivānanda, \"This time when you get your\nchild, you should give him the name Paramānanda dāsa.\" Caitanya\nMahāprabhu knew that pregnancy resulted from sex, but He did not\ncondemn sex in this case, as it was conducted according to scriptural\ninjunction.\nOn the other hand, there is the case of Junior Haridāsa. He was a\nsannyāsī, a renunciant, who was an intimate associate of the Lord. Once he\nmerely desired sex and did not actually partake of it, and immediately\nCaitanya Mahāprabhu, in His Paramātmā feature, could understand this."

Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Rāmānanda Rāya,\nand other intimate associates of Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested, \"Junior\nHaridāsa is Your eternal servant. Somehow or other he has committed this\noffense, but kindly excuse him.\" Still, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was firm\nin this respect and immediately replied, \"If you like Junior Haridāsa so\nmuch, better you remain with him, and I will go away.\" From that moment,\nnobody ventured again to request Caitanya Mahāprabhu to excuse Junior\nHaridāsa. When Junior Haridāsa became hopeless in his efforts to be\nexcused by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he went to Prayag and drowned himself\nin the confluence of the rivers Yamunā and Ganges. Although Lord\nCaitanya knew about this incident, after some time He inquired of His\nassociates, \"Where is Junior Haridāsa now?\"\nThey replied, \"Sir, You did not accept him, and so he has committed\nsuicide.\"\nLord Caitanya said, \"Yes, very good. This is very good.\"\nCaitanya Mahāprabhu was sometimes harder than stone and sometimes\nsofter than a flower. That is the behavior of the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. Śivānanda was a bona fide gṛhastha, obeying the rules and\nregulations of householder life, whereas Junior Haridāsa merely desired\nsex, but because he was in the renounced order of life he was condemned. A\nsannyāsī gives up his family and takes a vow to abstain from sex, but if he\nagain takes to sex he commits a very great sin.\nSo, Ajāmila was victimized by illicit sex with a prostitute. There are\nmany instances throughout the world in which even a purified person falls\nvictim to attraction by a prostitute and spends all his money on her.\nProstitute-hunting is so abominable that sex with a prostitute can ruin one's\ncharacter, destroy one's exalted position, and plunder all one's money.\nTherefore illicit sex is strictly prohibited. One should be satisfied with his\nmarried wife, for even a slight deviation will create havoc. A Kṛṣṇa\nconscious gṛhastha should always remember this. He should always be\nsatisfied with one wife and be peaceful simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa\nmantra. Otherwise at any moment he may fall down from his good position,\nas exemplified by the case of Ajāmila."

After hearing the statements of the Yamadūtas, the Viṣṇudūtas replied as\nfollows:\n\"Alas, how painful it is that irreligion is being introduced into an assembly where religion\nshould be maintained! Indeed, those in charge of maintaining religious principles are needlessly\npunishing a sinless, unpunishable person.\n\"A king or government official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer,\nand protector of the citizens because of affection and love. He should give the citizens good\nadvice and instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone.\nYamarāja does this, for he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his\nfootsteps. However, if such persons become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an\ninnocent person, where will the citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?\n\"The mass of people follow the example of a leader and imitate his behavior. They accept as\nevidence whatever the leader accepts. People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by\nwhich to discriminate between religion and irreligion. The innocent, unenlightened citizen is\nlike an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head on the lap of its master, faithfully\nbelieving in the master's protection. If a leader is actually kindhearted and deserves to be the\nobject of a living entity's faith, how can he punish or kill a foolish person who has fully\nsurrendered in good faith and friendship?\" (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.2.1–6)\nLogic and Reason\nThe Viṣṇudūtas, like all genuine servants of God, understood everything\naccording to logic and reason. The instructions of Kṛṣṇa are not\nmeaningless dogma. Religion often gives rise to dogmatism, but the author\nof Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, urges us to try to\nunderstand Lord Caitanya and the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness\naccording to logic. In other words, do not follow blindly, on the basis of\nsentiment alone. One who fails to apply logic can easily be misled by\nunscrupulous persons. For example, some so-called missionaries advertise\nthat man can become God, and they attract millions of sentimental\nfollowers. But how is it possible? Where is there evidence of any man\nbecoming God? This false propaganda is not at all logical. One should use\nhis intelligence to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

To do so would constitute an offense and a fall\nfrom spiritual principles.\nThe Duty of Governments\nThe Viṣṇudūtas accused the Yamadūtas of violating religious principles\nby attempting to drag Ajāmila to Yamarāja for punishment. Yamarāja is the\nofficer appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to judge religious\nand irreligious principles and to punish the sinful. However, if completely\nsinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamarāja is\ncontaminated. This principle applies not only in the assembly of Yamarāja\nbut throughout human society.\nUpholding religious principles is the duty of the king or government.\nUnfortunately, in the present age, Kali-yuga, people have lost their\nintelligence, so they cannot differentiate between dharma and adharma,\nreligion and irreligion. The courts do not know whom to punish and whom\nnot. For example, out of compassion for all the fallen souls, Vaiṣṇavas go\nout to preach the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but unfortunately,\nbecause of the influence of Kali-yuga, even though these Vaiṣṇavas have\ndedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord, they are\nsometimes harassed and punished by courts on false charges of disturbing\nthe peace.

Such corruption of the judicial system is very prominent in Kali-\nyuga. The judicial system is meant to provide for execution of justice, yet\nfalse witnesses and bribery make it difficult. With money, almost anyone\ncan get a favorable judgment in court. If the justice system is corrupt, life\nbecomes extremely troublesome. The government is supposed to offer the\ncitizens protection, as parents do for their children. A small child is\ncompletely dependent on his father and mother, thinking with full faith,\n\"My father is here, my mother is here-I am safe.\" But if the father and\nmother are corrupt, where is the protection for the child? Similarly, if the\nwhole government is corrupt, where is the protection for the citizens?"

The government spends billions of dollars, but the citizens have\nno security in their lives. The government is answerable to the citizens\nbecause it must protect and provide for them. If the government is incapable\nor corrupt, then what is the position of the citizens?\nThe king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian\nof the citizens by teaching them the proper goal of life. The human form of\nlife is especially meant for attaining self-realization, realization of one's\nrelationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The duty of the\ngovernment, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a\nway that they will gradually be elevated to the spiritual platform and realize\ntheir relationship with God. This principle was followed by kings like\nMahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Lord Rāmacandra, Mahārāja\nAmbarīṣa, and Prahlāda Mahārāja.\nUnfortunately, today's government leaders are generally dishonest and\nirreligious, and thus all the affairs of the state suffer.

We saw during the partition\ndays in India that although Hindus and Muslims had been living together\npeacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred\nbetween them, and thus the Hindus and Muslims killed one another over\npolitics.

Because Ajāmila\nhad chanted the holy name without offense, and because he chanted\nsincerely, he completely freed himself from all sinful reactions. This is why\nwe are stressing the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa so much. Pious activities,\nausterity, sacrifice-everything is done simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa\nmantra.

To\nchant the holy name of the Lord just to counteract one's sinful activities, or\nto commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, is\noffensive (nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ). But although Ajāmila\nengaged in sinful activities, he never chanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa to\ncounteract them; he simply chanted the name Nārāyaṇa to call his son.\nTherefore his chanting was effective. Because he chanted the holy name in\nthis way, he had already vanquished the accumulated sinful reactions of\nmany, many lives. The conclusion is that one who always chants the holy\nname of the Lord without offense is always pure. As confirmed in these\nverses, Ajāmila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of\nNārāyaṇa he remained sinless. It did not matter that he was calling his son;\nthe name itself was effective.\nFoolish persons say that one can chant any name, even a demigod's\nname, and get the same result as chanting the holy name of the Lord.

There is no other way. There is no\nother way. There is no other way.\" (Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa)\nBy taking up this chanting process, we are immediately freed from all\nsinful reactions. Thus we begin our spiritual life. Without being freed from\nsinful life, there is no possibility of becoming a pure Vaiṣṇava.\nOffenses Against the Holy Name\nEven a devotee may sometimes commit some sinful activity, either\nunknowingly or due to past sinful behavior. But if he sincerely repents,\nthinking, \"I should not have done this, but I am so sinful that I have again\ncommitted this sin,\" the Supreme Lord will excuse him on the basis of his\ngenuine repentance. However, if he intentionally commits sinful activities,"

Of\nthe ten kinds of offenses, committing sins on the strength of chanting is the\nmost serious. If after being freed from all sinful reactions by chanting Hare\nKṛṣṇa one again commits the same sins, he is guilty of a grievous crime.\nFor an ordinary man, that sinful activity may not be regarded so seriously,\nbut for one who is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, it is a dangerous offense, just as it\nis a serious crime for a government officer in a high post to take advantage\nof his position and accept a bribe. Such men are the most punishable\ncriminals. If a policeman steals, his crime and subsequent punishment are\ngreater than that of an ordinary man who steals. That is the law. Similarly,\none who takes gross advantage of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, thinking, \"I am\nchanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, so even if I commit some sin I'll be excused,\" will not\nachieve the ultimate goal of chanting the holy name. He becomes entangled\nin a cycle: he is freed, then he again commits sin, then he is freed and again\ncommits sin, freed and again commits sin. In this way he is never liberated.\nNevertheless, one should not think that one's sinful reactions will fail to\nbe counteracted by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. One of the ten offenses\nagainst the holy name of the Lord is to think that the holy name cannot\neradicate sinful reactions. Those who cultivate offenseless chanting of the\nHare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra should have firm faith in the words of the śāstra\nthat declare the chanting of the holy names of Kṛṣṇa to be supremely\npowerful.

By chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, a person is freed\nfrom all reactions to his previous sins, and if he avoids sinning again, he\nvery quickly becomes an advanced devotee.

In an\nassembly of Vaiṣṇavas, Haridāsa Ṭhākura said, \"Not only does a person\nbecome situated on the spiritual platform (brahma-bhūtaḥ) by offenselessly\nchanting the holy names of the Lord, but his dormant love of Godhead\nmanifests and he becomes liberated automatically.\"\nThe brāhmaṇa protested, \"Don't exaggerate the effects of chanting in\nthis way. One becomes liberated only after performing many austerities and\npenances. But you say that simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa one becomes\nliberated. If that is not the case, I shall certainly cut off your nose.\"\nHaridāsa Ṭhākura replied, \"If chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa does not produce\nliberation as a by-product, then I shall cut off my nose.\"\nThe members of the assembly witnessing this argument became\nextremely agitated upon seeing the great offense the brāhmaṇa had\ncommitted against Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and they immediately expelled the\noffender. Shortly thereafter, the brāhmaṇa contracted leprosy, and his\nbeautiful nose melted away. This incident is narrated in Śrī Caitanya-\ncaritāmṛta.\nThere are three stages of chanting the holy name: chanting with offense,\nchanting as a liberated person, and chanting with full love of God. These\nprogressive stages of chanting are like the ripening of a mango. An unripe\nmango tastes sour, but when the fruit is fully ripened, it tastes very sweet.\nInitially we may be reluctant to chant, but when we become liberated the\nchanting is so sweet that we cannot give it up. In this regard, Śrīla Rūpa\nGosvāmī has composed a beautiful verse describing the sweetness of the\nholy name of Kṛṣṇa:\ntuṇḍe tāṇḍavinī ratiṁ vitanute tuṇḍāvalī-labdhaye\nkarṇa-kroda-kaḍambinī ghaṭayate karṇārbudebhyaḥ spṛhām\ncetaḥ-prāṅgaṇa-saṅginī vijayate sarvendriyāṇāṁ kṛtiṁ\nno jāne janitā kiyadbhir amṛtaiḥ kṛṣṇeti varṇa-dvayī"

He writes\nthis commentary in the form a dialogue concerning how one can become\nfree from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord:\n\"Someone may say, 'It may be accepted that by chanting the holy name\nof the Lord one becomes freed from all the reactions of sinful life.\nHowever, if a person commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only\nonce but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions\nof such sins even after atoning for them for twelve years or more.

Ordinary\natonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not\ncompletely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts.\nTherefore atonement is not as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of\nthe Lord. In the śāstras it is said that if a person only once chants the holy\nname and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord\nimmediately considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him\nprotection. This is confirmed by Śrīdhara Svāmī. Thus when Ajāmila was in\ngreat danger of being carried off by the order-carriers of Yamarāja, the Lord\nimmediately sent His personal order-carriers to protect him, and because\nAjāmila was freed from all sinful reactions, the Viṣṇudūtas spoke on his\nbehalf.\n\"Ajāmila had named his son Nārāyaṇa, and because he loved the boy\nvery much, he would call him again and again. Although he was calling for\nhis son, the name itself was powerful, because the name Nārāyaṇa is not\ndifferent from Lord Nārāyaṇa. When Ajāmila named his son Nārāyaṇa, all\nthe reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling\nhis son and thus chanting the holy name of Nārāyaṇa thousands of times, he\nwas actually unconsciously advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\"One may argue, 'Since Ajāmila was constantly chanting the name of\nNārāyaṇa, how was it possible for him to be associating with a prostitute\nand thinking of wine?' By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering upon\nhimself again and again, and therefore one may say that only his chanting of\nthe holy name of Nārāyaṇa at the time of death-and not his chanting during\nhis lifetime-was the cause of his being freed. However, his chanting during\nhis life would then have been a nāma-aparādha. Nāmno balād yasya hi\npāpa-buddhiḥ: one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his\nsins by chanting the holy name of the Lord is a nāma-aparādhī, an offender\nto the holy name.\n\"In response it may be said that Ajāmila's chanting throughout his life\nwas inoffensive because he did not chant the name of Nārāyaṇa with the\npurpose of counteracting his sins.

Indeed, even his first utterance of the\nholy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life. To cite\na logical example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time\nthe fruits are available. Similarly, Ajāmila's devotional service grew little by\nlittle, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the reactions\ndid not affect him. In the śāstras it is said that if one chants the holy name\nof the Lord even once, the reactions of past, present, or future sinful life do\nnot affect him. To give another example, if one extracts the poison fangs of\na serpent, this saves the serpent's future victims from poisonous effects,\neven if the serpent bites repeatedly.

Although ritualistic atonement may free one from sinful reactions, it does not awaken\ndevotional service, unlike the chanting of the Lord's names, which reminds one of the Lord's\nfame, qualities, attributes, pastimes, and paraphernalia.\n\"The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are\ninsufficient to cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one's mind again runs\ntoward material activities. Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive\nreactions of material activities, the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, or glorification of the\nname, fame, and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as the most perfect process of\natonement because such chanting completely eradicates the dirt from one's heart.\n\"At the time of death, Ajāmila helplessly and very loudly chanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa.\nThat chanting alone has already freed him from the reactions of all sinful life. Therefore, O\nservants of Yamarāja, do not try to take him to your master for punishment in hellish\nconditions.\n\"One who chants the holy name of the Lord is immediately freed from the reactions of\nunlimited sins, even if he chants the holy name jokingly, for musical entertainment,\nneglectfully, or even to indicate something else. This is accepted by all learned scholars of the\nscriptures.\n\"If a person somehow or other chants the holy name of Hari while dying because of an\naccident, such as falling from the top of a house, slipping and suffering broken bones while\ntraveling on the road, being bitten by a snake, being afflicted with pain and high fever, or being\ninjured by a weapon, he is immediately absolved from having to enter hellish life, even if he was\nsinful throughout his life.\n\"Learned scholars and sages have carefully ascertained that one should atone for the heaviest\nsins by undergoing a heavy process of atonement and one should atone for lighter sins by\nundergoing lighter atonement. But chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra vanquishes all the effects\nof sinful activities, regardless of whether heavy or light.\n\"Although one may neutralize the reactions of sinful life through austerity, charity, vows, and\nother such methods, these pious activities cannot uproot the material desires in one's heart.\nHowever, one who serves the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead is immediately freed from\nall such contaminations.\n\"As a fire burns dry grass to ashes, so the holy name of the Lord, whether chanted knowingly\nor unknowingly, unfailingly burns to ashes all the reactions of one's sinful activities.\n\"Even if a person is unaware of the potency of a certain medicine, if he takes that medicine or\nis forced to take it, it will act even without his knowledge, for its potency does not depend on\nthe patient's understanding.

Then the Yamadūtas went to Yamarāja and explained to him\neverything that had happened.\nThe brāhmaṇa Ajāmila was now free from fear, having been released from the nooses of\nYamarāja's servants. Coming to his senses, he immediately offered obeisances to the\nViṣṇudūtas by bowing his head at their lotus feet. He was extremely pleased by their presence,\nfor he had seen them save his life from the hands of the servants of Yamarāja. But when the\nViṣṇudūtas saw that Ajāmila was attempting to say something, they suddenly disappeared from\nhis presence. (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.2.11–23)\nAtonement vs. Chanting the Holy Name\nHere the Viṣṇudūtas say that the Vedic scriptures recommend various\nmeans of atonement, by which a person may be delivered from the reactions\nof his sinful activities. In Christianity there is also a means of atonement. If\na Catholic commits a sin, for example, he is instructed to go to a priest and\nconfess: \"I have committed such-and-such sin.\" The priest is supposed to be\nan authorized representative of God, and so if he excuses the sinner, the sin\nbecomes nullified.\nHowever, such atonement cannot purify the sinful man as much as the\npurifying process of chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The man who\nconfesses to having sinned leaves the church and often commits the same\nsin again. In other words, there is no question of becoming purified by this\nprocess of atonement.\nStill, atonement of various kinds is recommended in the Vedas for those\nwho are not ready to take up the process of pure devotional service. These\nmethods of atonement are proportional to the the severity of the sin they are\nmeant to counteract. For example, if we fall sick with a cough or influenza,\nthe cost of medicine prescribed by the doctor may be little, but if we are\nstricken with tuberculosis, the medicine will be more costly. Likewise,\nprāyaścitta, or the ritualistic ceremonies for counteracting sinful activities,\nis proportionately less or greater according to the gravity of the sin. If we\ncommit a grievous sin, then the penance will be severe. These are the\nprescriptions given by great sages like Parāśara Muni and Manu. The sages\nhave composed twenty kinds of scriptures, constituting the dharma-śāstra,\nand these scriptures are meant for atoning for one's sins and elevating one to\nthe heavenly planets.

One who practices these principles of atonement\nis like a rascal patient who goes to a physician for treatment. The physician\ngives him medicine and instructs him how to take it, but the foolish patient\ntakes the medicine according to his own whims, and so his condition\nworsens. Again he goes to the physician, crying \"Doctor, please give me\nmore medicine.\"\nIn this regard, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura describes an incident\nthat took place when Sāmba, one of Lord Kṛṣṇa's sons, was rescued from\nthe punishment of the Kauravas. Sāmba fell in love with Lakṣmaṇā, the\ndaughter of Duryodhana, and since according to kṣatriya custom one is not\noffered a kṣatriya's daughter unless he displays his chivalrous valor, Sāmba\nabducted her. Consequently Sāmba was arrested by the Kauravas. Later,\nwhen Lord Balarāma came to rescue him, there was an argument about\nSāmba's release. Since the argument was not settled, Balarāma showed His\npower in such a way that all of Hastināpura trembled and would have been\nvanquished as if by a great earthquake. Then the matter was settled, and\nSāmba married Duryodhana's daughter. The purport is that one should take\nshelter of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, whose protective power is so great that it\ncannot be equaled in the material world. However powerful the reactions of\none's sins, they will immediately be vanquished if one chants the name of\nHari, Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma, or Nārāyaṇa.\nTherefore such rituals of atonement as fasting and giving charity are not\naccepted by the Viṣṇudūtas. They say, \"Such prescribed ritualistic\nceremonies cannot purify a man as effectively as chanting the holy name of\nGod.\" Undoubtedly one becomes free from all contamination of sinful life\nby executing particular religious principles, but these are ultimately\ninsufficient, because the mind is so disturbed that even after being freed"

But pure devotional service is\nanyābhilāṣitā-śūnya, free from material desires. One who is situated in\ndevotional service no longer has material desires, and thus he is beyond\nsinful life. Material desires should be completely stopped. Otherwise,\nalthough one's austerities, penances, and charity may free one from sin for\nthe time being, one's desires will reappear because his heart is impure. Thus\nhe will act sinfully and suffer. The special advantage of devotional service\nis that it frees one of all material desires.\nOne cannot purify one's heart by atonement alone. A patient suffering\nfrom syphilis goes to the doctor, who gives him an injection and charges a\nhigh fee. Yes, he may be cured, but when he again engages in illicit sex, he\nonce again contracts syphilis. So his heart was not purified of the desire for\nillicit sex. But if one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he forgets illicit sex.\nThat is the test of one's Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A sincere devotee never\ncommits sin, because his heart has become purified by chanting the holy\nname and engaging in devotional service.\nOf course, there are pseudodevotees who commit sinful activities on the\nstrength of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. They are great offenders against the holy\nname. We should not use the holy name like a machine, thinking that\nbecause the chanting process consumes sinful reactions we can freely\ncommit more sin. This is the greatest offense against the holy name of\nKṛṣṇa. Whatever sins we may have previously committed are immediately\neradicated by offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord, even just\nonce. But we must not sin again. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu forgave the\nsinful Jagāi and Mādhāi, who had been drunkards, woman-hunters, meat-\neaters, and gamblers.

We shall not do them anymore.\" When a person\nis initiated by a spiritual master, the reactions of his sins immediately\nbecome nullified. But that does not mean he can again commit sins.\nKṛṣṇa consciousness means following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya,\nand so we initiate disciples according to the principle he showed in the case\nof Jagāi and Mādhāi.

Thus one serves the Lord by\nremembering His form, attributes, and pastimes.\nŚrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that it is because of the Lord's\nomnipotence that this is all possible simply by chanting His holy name.\nWhat cannot be achieved through the performance of Vedic rituals can\neasily be achieved through the chanting of the Lord's holy name. To chant\nthe holy name and dance in ecstasy is so easy, sublime, and effective that\none can readily achieve all the benefits of spiritual life simply by following\nthis process. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu declares, paraṁ vijayate\nśrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam: \"All glories to the congregational chanting of Lord\nKṛṣṇa's holy name!\" The saṅkīrtana movement we have started offers the\nbest process for immediately becoming purified of all sinful reactions and\ncoming to the platform of spiritual life."

Why should God not have a form? We have a\nform because our father has a form. So why should the supreme father not\nhave a form? In the Bhagavad-gītā (14.4) Kṛṣṇa says, ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ\npitā: \"I am the seed-giving father of all beings.\" The Christians also believe\nthat God is the supreme father. If the sons all have forms, how is it that the\nfather has no form? We cannot be born of a father who is formless. Īśvaraḥ\nparamaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ: \"Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller\nand the cause of all causes, and He possesses an eternal form of knowledge\nand bliss.\" (Brahma-saṁhitā 5.1) Vigraha means \"form.\" If God is the\ncause of all causes, the creator, and He is creating all these forms, how can\nHe be formless?\nGod has a form, but it is not a form like ours. His form is sac-cid-\nānanda, but ours is just the opposite. God's form is sat, eternally existing,\nwhile man's form is asat, temporary. God's form is cit, full of knowledge,\nbut ours is acit, full of ignorance. And His form is full of ānanda, bliss, but\nours is full of nirānanda, misery. It is only because we cannot conceive of a\nform so different from ours that sometimes it is said God is nirākāra,\nwithout form.\nGod's form is transcendental. That means His body is not material but\nspiritual. His form is of a different nature than that to which we are\naccustomed. In the Vedas it is said that God sees but that He has no eyes.\nThis means that God's eyes are unlike ours-they are spiritual, not material.\nWe can see only so far, whereas God can see everything because He has\neyes everywhere. His eyes, His form, His hands and legs are of a different\nnature than ours.\nUnlike our knowledge, Kṛṣṇa's knowledge is unlimited. As He says in\nthe Bhagavad-gītā (7.26), \"I know past, present, future-everything.\" Earlier\n(Bhagavad-gītā 4.5) He reminds Arjuna, \"Both you and I have taken many\nbirths. I remember them all, but you have forgotten them.\" Thus there is no\nlimit to His knowledge. His knowledge, His body, and His happiness are\ncompletely different from our knowledge, body, and happiness. Therefore it"

Kṛṣṇa declares this in the Bhagavad-\ngītā (7.24): avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ manyante mām abuddhayaḥ.\n\"Unintelligent men think that I was impersonal before and have now\nassumed this personality.\" In another place in the Bhagavad-gītā, those who\nderide the personal form of God are called mūḍhās, or asses. God certainly\nhas a form, but His form is entirely different from ours. That is the real\nunderstanding of nirākāra.\nAnd just as Kṛṣṇa's form is not like our material forms, so His pastimes\nare also not of this material nature. Anyone who knows this is immediately\nliberated. Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the Bhagavad-gītā (4.9),\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ\ntyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma\nnaiti mām eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities\ndoes not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world,\nbut attains my eternal abode.\" Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa\npurely, one can come to understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord and\nthus become liberated. Chanting is easy and sublime. One who\noffenselessly chants Hare Kṛṣṇa will always remember Kṛṣṇa's form,\npastimes, qualities, and entourage, and that remembrance will liberate him\nfrom all sinful reactions and all material bondage.\nThe Viṣṇudūtas here declare that although there are many methods\nprescribed in the Vedas for attaining liberation from sinful reactions, these\nmethods are all insufficient, because they cannot elevate a person to the\nstandard of absolute purity. Those who practice other methods of\npurification mentioned in the Vedas generally desire some material benefit,\nsuch as elevation to the heavenly kingdom.

That is real\nhappiness. We try to please Kṛṣṇa. Kaṁsa was also Kṛṣṇa conscious,\ninsofar as he was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, but his meditation was\nunfavorable. His meditation was on how to kill Kṛṣṇa. He was thinking of\nKṛṣṇa, but he thought of Him as his enemy. That is certainly not bhakti, or\ndevotion. Thinking of Kṛṣṇa but being opposed to His desire, opposed to\nsatisfying Him, is not bhakti. One must act favorably in Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness. Arjuna was a devotee because he acted favorably, for the\nsatisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. Materially speaking, Arjuna's actions appear\nunfavorable, but they were favorable as far as Kṛṣṇa was concerned.\nTherefore they were perfect and free from all sin.\nLord Kṛṣṇa's Transcendental Pastimes\nIt is important to understand the difference between activities of bhakti\nand ordinary pious activities. Cultivation of knowledge and pious activities\nis on the material platform. Piety does not amount to liberation. A pious\nman is situated on the platform of goodness, but he remains a conditioned\nsoul, bound up by good reactions. One may even become a brāhmaṇa, a\nvery pious man, but that does not mean he has become a devotee. And\nsometimes a devotee appears to act against the rules of mundane piety.\nArjuna, for example, was an exalted devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but he killed\nhis relatives. Ignorant people may say, \"Arjuna is not a good man. Look, he\nkilled his grandfather, his teacher, and his nephews, devastating the entire\nfamily.\" But in the Bhagavad-gītā (4.3) Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, bhakto 'si me:\n\"You are My very dear friend.\" In the estimation of the material world\nArjuna may not be a good man, but because he is a soul surrendered to the\ndesire of the Supreme Lord, he must be accepted as a devotee. While it is\ntrue that Arjuna killed his own kinsmen, in the eyes of Kṛṣṇa he remained a\ndear friend and devotee. That is the difference between a devotee and a\ngood man of this world: A good man of this world tries to always act\npiously, for he knows that if he acts badly he will suffer sinful reactions; but"

Some persons with\nmaterial vision are very much attracted to Kṛṣṇa's rāsa-līlā-His pastimes\nwith His cowherd girlfriends-but they do not appreciate His fighting and\nkilling the demons. They do not know that the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa, is\ngood in any and all circumstances. Whether He is enjoying in the company\nof His devotees or killing the demons, He remains the Absolute Truth, and\ntherefore all His pastimes are equally purifying to hear.\nGenerally people go to hear the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from professional\nreciters, who are especially fond of describing the rāsa-līlā. The people\nthink, \"Oh, Kṛṣṇa is embracing a girl-this is very nice.\" At times ten\nthousand people will gather to hear the rāsa-līlā, and in this way the reciters\nearn a nice profit. Thus people come to think that the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nmeans the Tenth Canto, which contains the rāsa-līlā and other pastimes, but\nwhat they don't realize is that there are so many important instructions in\nthe other cantos as well. Lord Kṛṣṇa, the summum bonum, is described in\nthe Tenth Canto, and the other nine cantos are especially meant for\npurifying the heart so that one may understand Kṛṣṇa.\nTherefore we instruct everyone first of all to read the first nine cantos of\nthe Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam very carefully.

In the material\nworld, the living entities are inclined to go astray. The mind and senses\ngenerally become attracted to material objects of desire. But one should\ndraw one's mind to the eternal by the practice of bhakti-yoga. Otherwise,\none's mind and senses will force one to perform karma, activities for\npersonal sense gratification. And as soon as a person engages in sense\ngratification, he commits sin. Therefore to avoid karmic activities, which\nquickly entangle one in the process of repeated birth and death, one must\ntake to the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\nHere the Viṣṇudūtas advise us in the same way: If we want to be freed\nfrom the reactions of karma, we should glorify the Supreme Lord twenty-\nfour hours a day. That will purify us.

For example, if a person falls from a high rooftop\nbut somehow or other cries out \"Hare Kṛṣṇa!\" that cry will be heard by the\nLord. Or, if in our sleep we dream that a tiger is coming to eat us and we\nchant Hare Kṛṣṇa in our sleep, the Lord hears that also.\nAlthough Ajāmila indirectly chanted the holy name of Lord Nārāyaṇa\nthrough the medium of the name of his youngest son, he at once\nremembered Lord Nārāyaṇa. Therefore in Vedic society children are given\nGod's names. It is not that the child becomes God. If we name a child\nNārāyaṇa, it is understood that he is Nārāyaṇa dāsa, the servant of Lord\nNārāyaṇa. Similarly, we give our disciples spiritual names, such as Viṣṇu\ndāsa, Vāmana dāsa, or Kṛṣṇa dāsa. That Ajāmila remembered Lord\nNārāyaṇa by calling his son of the same name is confirmed in the Śrīmad-\nBhāgavatam, which says that the power of the sound vibration of the holy\nname is absolute.\nOne attains freedom from all sinful reactions immediately upon\nrecitation of the holy name, even if one does not understand the potency of\nthe name. Whether one is chanting with devotion and reverence or without\nany faith, more sinful reactions are vanquished than a sinful man can\ncommit. Kṛṣṇa's name has such unlimited potency. When Caitanya\nMahāprabhu was chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra in Navadvīpa, the\npeople used to imitate the Lord and His associates. At that time the land\nwas ruled by Mohammedans, and sometimes the people would go to one of\nthe government officials and complain, \"The Hindus are chanting 'Hare\nKṛṣṇa! Hare Kṛṣṇa!' dancing wildly, and thrashing their arms about.\" In this\nway they imitated the saṅkīrtana of Lord Caitanya. In Western countries the\nonlookers also imitate our chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa when we go out to chant\non the street. Even by imitating, however, they become purified. The holy\nname is so powerful that if someone derides us, saying, \"Why are you\nchanting Hare Kṛṣṇa-it is nonsense!\" he also gets spiritual benefit.\nThe chanting of Kṛṣṇa's holy name is like the sun rising in one's\ndarkened heart.

Due to impious activities we are in ignorance,\nbut to those who constantly engage in the service of the Lord with love and\naffection, Kṛṣṇa reveals Himself in the heart. By Kṛṣṇa's special mercy, the\ndevotees are always kept in the light of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa knows\neveryone's intention or motive, and His mercy is especially meant for those\nwho are sincerely engaged in His service.\nKṛṣṇa is equal to everyone, and as such, His mercy is unlimited.\nHowever, He is very much inclined toward His devotees. If one is prepared\nto accept His mercy unlimitedly, then He is prepared to give it unlimitedly.\nOn account of our envious nature, however, we are not prepared to take His\nmercy. In the Bhagavad-gītā (18.66) Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-dharmān parityajya\nmām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja/ ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi: \"Just\ngive up all other so-called religions and surrender to Me alone. I shall\nprotect you from all sinful reactions.\" He openly offers His protection, but\nwe do not take it. Sunlight is also equally distributed throughout the\nuniverse, but if we close the door and do not come out to take advantage of\nit, that is our own fault. Sunlight and moonlight do not discriminate,\nilluminating the houses of brāhmaṇas while leaving caṇḍālas' [dogeaters']\nhouses in darkness. No, the light is distributed indiscriminately. Similarly,\nthe mercy of Kṛṣṇa is equally available to everyone, but it is up to each\nindividual to accept God's freely distributed mercy.\nNaturally Kṛṣṇa bestows more mercy upon His devotee, because the\ndevotee has the capacity to accept that mercy through service. The process\nof receiving the causeless mercy of the Lord is to render more and more\nservice. We should be very enthusiastic to render service to the Lord. That\nenthusiasm will come when we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa with faith and\ndetermination.\nSomeone may argue, \"I can see how chanting the holy name with faith is\npurifying, but if a man has no faith, then how will the holy name act?\" Here\nare some examples: If an innocent child touches fire, knowingly or\nunknowingly, it will burn him.

In countries where the Hare Kṛṣṇa\nmovement is spreading, learned scholars and other thoughtful men are\nrealizing its effectiveness. For example, Dr. J. Stillson Judah, a learned\nscholar, has been very much attracted to this movement because he has\nactually seen that it is turning hippies addicted to drugs into pure Vaiṣṇavas\nwho voluntarily become servants of Kṛṣṇa and humanity. Even a few years\nago, such hippies did not know the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, but now they are\nchanting it and becoming pure Vaiṣṇavas. Thus they are becoming free from\nall sinful activities, such as illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and\ngambling. This is practical proof of the effectiveness of the Hare Kṛṣṇa\nmantra. One may or may not know the value of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa\nmantra, but if one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be\npurified, just as one who takes a potent medicine will feel its effects,\nregardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly.\nAnother analogy: fire will act, regardless of whether handled by an\ninnocent child or by someone well aware of its power. If a field of dry grass\nis set afire, either by a man who knows the power of fire or by a child who\ndoes not, the grass will be burned to ashes. Similarly, a person may or may\nnot know the power of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, but if he chants the\nholy name, he will become free from all sinful reactions. This is the correct\nconclusion of the Viṣṇudūtas.\nExtended Lease on Life\nThe servants of Yamarāja are so powerful that generally they cannot be\nhindered anywhere, but this time they were baffled and disappointed in their\nattempt to take away a man they considered sinful. Therefore they\nimmediately returned to Yamarāja and described to him everything that had\nhappened.

First he offers respects to his spiritual master, next to his\ngrand–spiritual master, next to his great-grand–spiritual master, and then to\nall devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa.\nVaiṣṇavas are also Viṣṇudūtas because they carry out the orders of\nKṛṣṇa. Lord Kṛṣṇa is very eager for all the conditioned souls rotting in this\nmaterial world to surrender to Him and be saved from material pangs in this\nlife and punishment in hellish conditions after death. A Vaiṣṇava therefore\ntries to bring conditioned souls to their senses. Those who are fortunate like\nAjāmila are saved by the Viṣṇudūtas, or Vaiṣṇavas, and thus they return\nhome, back to Godhead.\nGood examples of merciful Vaiṣṇavas are the six Gosvāmīs. They\nscrutinizingly studied all kinds of scriptures to establish the principles of\nKṛṣṇa consciousness. In the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu (The Nectar of\nDevotion) Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī quotes many verses from different scriptures\nin support of the principles of bhakti.

Furthermore, Ajāmila heard glorification of the name, fame, qualities,\nand pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He thus became a perfectly pure devotee.\nHe could then remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.\nAjāmila said, \"Alas, being a servant of my senses, how degraded I became!

Indeed, I gave\nup my chaste and beautiful young wife to have sexual intercourse with a fallen prostitute\naccustomed to drinking wine. All condemnation upon me! My father and mother were old and\nhad no one to look after them. Because I did not take care of them, they lived with great\ndifficulty.

Having reached this platform, Ajāmila\nbegan to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name,\nfame, form, and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who\ntakes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness naturally endeavors to follow the rules of\ndevotional service, and he regularly chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra:\nHare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma,\nRāma Rāma, Hare Hare. A person should not suppose that because he has\ntaken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness he can continue his sinful activities and have\ntheir effects counteracted. We have repeatedly warned that this is the\ngreatest offense against the holy name. Like Ajāmila, one should repent,\n\"How unfortunate I was to engage in so many sinful activities! But now, by\nthe grace of Kṛṣṇa, I have come to know that I was acting improperly.\"\nThus Ajāmila greatly repented, remembering all his sinful activities. He\nremembered that he had been trained by his father to be a first-class\nbrāhmaṇa, that he had been educated in the science of the Vedas, and that\nhe had married a beautiful and chaste wife, a girl who was innocent and\nhighly qualified, having come from a respectable brāhmaṇa family. Ajāmila\nnow lamented, \"I rejected her and accepted a prostitute, an abominable\ndrunkard!\"\nIt is a Vedic regulation that men of the higher classes-brāhmaṇas,\nkṣatriyas, and vaiśyas-do not beget children in the wombs of lower-class\nwomen. Therefore the custom in Vedic society is to examine the horoscopes\nof a girl and boy being considered for marriage to see whether their\ncombination is suitable. Vedic astrology reveals whether one has been born\nin the brāhmaṇa class, the kṣatriya class, the vaiśya class, or the śūdra\nclass, according to the three qualities of material nature. The horoscope\nmust be examined because a marriage between a boy of the brāhmaṇa class\nand a girl of the śūdra class is incompatible; married life would be\nmiserable for both husband and wife. Of course, this is a material"

But if the boy and girl are\ndevotees, there need be no such considerations. A devotee is transcendental,\nand therefore in a marriage between devotees, the boy and girl form a very\nhappy combination.\nAjāmila thought, \"Because I failed to be self-controlled, I was degraded\nto an abominable life and all my brahminical qualifications were nullified.\"\nThis is the mentality of one who is becoming a pure devotee. When one is\nelevated to the platform of devotional service by the grace of the Lord and\nthe spiritual master, one first regrets his past sinful activities. This helps one\nadvance in spiritual life. The Viṣṇudūtas had given Ajāmila the chance to\nbecome a pure devotee, and the first duty of a devotee is to regret his past\nsinful activities in illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling. Not\nonly should a devotee give up his past bad habits, but he must always regret\nhis past sinful acts. This is the standard of pure devotion.\nDebts to Pay\nAjāmila repented his negligence in performing his duty to his wife,\nfather, and mother. It is the duty of grown-up children to render service to\ntheir aged parents. This practice should be reintroduced into present society.\nOtherwise, what is the use of family life? Proper family life means that the\nhusband should be protective, the wife chaste, and the children grateful to\ntheir father and mother. Children should think, \"My father and mother gave\nme so much service. When I was unable to walk, they carried me. When I\nwas unable to eat, they fed me. They gave me an education. They gave me\nlife.\" A bona fide son thinks of ways to render service to his father and\nmother. And just as a woman is expected to be faithful to her husband, so\nthe husband should be grateful for her service and protect her. Because of\nhis association with a prostitute, however, Ajāmila had abandoned all his\nduties. Regretting this, he now considered himself quite fallen.\nAccording to the Vedic social system, as soon as one takes birth he\nbecomes indebted to so many persons. We are indebted to the ṛṣis, or great\nsages, because we derive knowledge from their transcendental writings,\nsuch as the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, compiled by Śrīla Vyāsadeva. The authors\nof the scripture know past, present, and future, and we are urged to take\nadvantage of such invaluable knowledge. Thus we are indebted to the sages."

For example, we take milk from the cow. According to Vedic\nunderstanding, the cow is considered one of our mothers because we drink\nher milk, just as at birth we drink our mother's milk. The Śrīmad-\nBhāgavatam lists seven mothers: our own mother, the wife of our teacher or\nspiritual master, the wife of a brāhmaṇa, the wife of the king, the nurse, the\ncow, and the earth. We are indebted to all seven of these mothers, and also\nto our father, brothers, friends, relatives, and forefathers.\nAlso, if someone accepts charity, he becomes indebted, and that debt has\nto be repaid, just as borrowed money must be repaid. Therefore devotees\nshould not accept charity from anyone unless they intend to spend it in\nKṛṣṇa's service. For a devotee to accept donations just to satisfy his belly is\na great sin. Brāhmaṇas and sannyāsīs who accept charity from others must\naccept it with great caution. According to the Vedic social structure, only\nthe brahmacārī, sannyāsī, and brāhmaṇa are allowed to collect money in\ncharity. An ordinary householder must not. The brahmacārī may collect\nalms from the public for serving his spiritual master, and a sannyāsī may\ncollect money for serving God, Kṛṣṇa. The Vedas likewise direct people to\ngive charity to the brāhmaṇas because they know how to spend it for Kṛṣṇa.\nCharity given to a worthy person is in the mode of goodness, charity given\nfor one's own personal benefit is touched with the mode of passion, and\ncharity given without any consideration is sunk in the mode of ignorance.\nFor instance, if we give money to a rascal, he will likely take it to the\nnearest liquor shop. Those who are rich may think it does not matter-they\ncan afford not to discriminate-but the scriptures describe these three kinds\nof charity.\nWe may well ask, How can one hope to liquidate all his debts? The\nanswer is: only by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, or Mukunda.\nThe name Mukunda indicates one who liberates us from material\ncontamination. We are indebted to the demigods, but we cannot take shelter\nof them. If we actually want shelter, we should take shelter of Kṛṣṇa,"

Simply by\ntaking shelter of Lord Nārāyaṇa, who is nondifferent from Mukunda,\nAjāmila became free. Similarly, if we want to be free from all sinful\nreactions, we have no alternative but to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. As Kṛṣṇa\nrecommends, mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja: \"Simply surrender unto Me.\" We\nshould follow Kṛṣṇa's advice.

Even for those who\nare pure devotees there is the danger of falling down from the standard of\npurity.

Similarly, a kṣatriya has his,\nand so also do the vaiśya and śūdra. If a person gives up his occupational\nduties and takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, strictly following all the rules and\nregulations, but if due to his immature execution of devotional service he\nfalls down, there is still no loss for him. Whatever he does as service to the\nSupreme Lord, although it may be a small percentage of his whole life, will\nremain to his credit. He does not lose it.\nOn the other hand, one who perfectly executes his occupational duties\nbut fails to worship Kṛṣṇa ultimately gains nothing. Strictly discharging\none's occupational duties means living a life of piety. But suppose through\nthese pious activities you are promoted to the heavenly kingdom.

That means he must accept another term of material life.\nSo it is not a sound idea to hope for acquisition of the effects of pious\nactivities.\nUnfortunately, even in India people are more inclined to perform pious\nactivities, such as giving in charity, than to take up devotional service to\nKṛṣṇa. They hope that by performing such tapasya, or austerity, they will be\nelevated at death to a higher standard of material life in the heavenly\nplanets. They also worship demigods for this purpose, or to gain a\nbenediction in this life. Lord Śiva, for example, very quickly gives his\nworshiper material benedictions-whatever his devotee wants. He is very\nkind. He is known as Āśutoṣa, \"he who is easily satisfied.\" For this reason\npeople are fond of worshiping him for material prosperity. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa\ncondemns such worship in the Bhagavad-gītā (7.20): kāmais tais tair hṛta-\njñānāḥ prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ. \"Those whose intelligence has been\nstolen by material desires surrender unto the demigods.\"\nThe Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam tells the story of Vṛkāsura, who sought a\nterrible benediction from Lord Śiva. Vṛkāsura asked that whoever he would\ntouch upon the head would be destroyed. This is the sort of benediction\nsought by demons. Rāvaṇa and Hiraṇyakaśipu also received such\nbenedictions. They thought that by becoming powerful they could elude\ndeath. This is typical demoniac mentality.\nNone of these demons, however, was saved from death by the\nbenediction received from the demigods. Rather, ultimately they were all\nkilled by the Supreme Lord. It is nature's law that everyone here must die.\nNo one who takes birth in the material world can live eternally. The\nmaterial world is called Martyaloka, meaning that every living entity here is\nsubject to birth, death, old age, and disease. In illusion, people do not see\nthis. They try to adjust their material condition so that they can live\nperpetually. Modern scientists also aspire to be immortal, in imitation of\nHiraṇyakaśipu. This is all foolishness. One should not be afraid of dying,\nbut one should be cautious and ask, \"What sort of situation will I attain in\nmy next life as a result of my activities?\""

But I only ask that, in whatever\ncondition I may live, by Your mercy I will never forget You.\" A devotee is\nnot afraid, but he is cautious not to fall down. At the same time, he knows\nthat whatever percentage of devotional service he renders is to his\npermanent credit. The story of Ajāmila is the perfect illustration of that\npoint. We should follow the rules and regulations very strictly, but even if\nwe fall down, there is no loss. That is the statement of Nārada Muni quoted\nabove. Even if one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the basis of sentiment\nand executes devotional service for only some time and again returns to\nmaterial life, whatever service he has rendered is recorded, and one day he\nwill be saved, just as Ajāmila was saved.\nAfter the Viṣṇudūtas disappeared, Ajāmila at first wondered whether he\nhad been dreaming that they had come to release him from the binding\nropes of the Yamadūtas. When Ajāmila was on his deathbed, practically in a\ncoma, he actually saw the Yamadūtas and Viṣṇudūtas, but it seemed to him\nthat he was just dreaming. When he saw that he was in fact released from\nthe fearsome agents of Yamarāja, he wanted to see the Viṣṇudūtas again.\nThey had appeared very splendid. Their bodily features were just like those\nof Lord Viṣṇu, and they were decorated like Him and carried the four\nsymbols of His potency: the conchshell, lotus, club, and disc. Their bodies\nshone with a very beautiful luster, and their dress was of golden silk.\nTherefore Ajāmila inquired, \"Where are those beautiful personalities who\nreleased me from the bondage of the Yamadūtas?\"\nAjāmila thought, \"My whole life was full of sinful activities, so how\ncould I be worthy of seeing such great personalities?\" He concluded,\n\"Perhaps in my previous life I did something good, and as a result I have\nbeen allowed to see the Viṣṇudūtas.\" In fact, early in life Ajāmila had been\na faithful servant of Lord Nārāyaṇa, and as a result he was able to see the\nViṣṇudūtas. It was the good association Ajāmila had been blessed with in\nhis early days that saved him. As stated in the Caitanya-caritāmṛta\n(Madhya 22.54),\n'sādhu-saṅga', 'sādhu-saṅga'-sarva-śāstre kaya\nlava-mātra sādhu-saṅge sarva-siddhi haya"

Certainly this was\ndue to good counsel given from within by the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. As the Lord says in the Bhagavad-gītā (15.15), sarvasya cāhaṁ\nhṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca: \"I am seated in\neveryone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge, and\nforgetfulness.\" The Lord is so kind that if one has ever rendered service to\nHim, the Lord never forgets him. Thus the Lord, from within, gave Ajāmila\nthe inspiration to name his youngest son Nārāyaṇa so that in affection he\nwould constantly call \"Nārāyaṇa! Nārāyaṇa!\" and thus be saved from the\nmost fearful and dangerous condition at the time of his death. Such is the\nmercy of Kṛṣṇa. Guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja: by the mercy of\nthe guru and Kṛṣṇa, one receives the seed of bhakti, devotional service.\nWatering this seed by the process of hearing and chanting the name of the\nLord saves a devotee from the greatest fear.\nIn our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee's\nname to one that reminds him of Viṣṇu. If at the time of death the devotee\ncan remember his own name, such as Kṛṣṇa dāsa or Govinda dāsa, he can\nbe saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the\ntime of initiation is essential. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so\nmeticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to remember Kṛṣṇa\nsomehow or other.\nRemembrance of Kṛṣṇa at the time of death is generally possible only for\npersons who have established an intimate relationship with Kṛṣṇa\nthroughout a lifetime of devotional service. When Ajāmila was a young boy\nhe was trained by his father to be completely faithful to the Lord, and until\nthe age of twenty he served Lord Nārāyaṇa very nicely. Although Ajāmila\nhad fallen down from the standard of devotional service to Lord Nārāyaṇa\nand forgotten his relationship with Him, Nārāyaṇa did not forget, and in\nAjāmila's hour of need He reciprocated His devotee's love. Thus Ajāmila\nwas given the presence of mind to remember Nārāyaṇa at the time of death."

This is the best process of yoga,\nas confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gītā\n(6.47):\nyoginām api sarveṣāṁ\nmad-gatenāntar-ātmanā\nśraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ\nsa me yuktatamo mataḥ\n\"Of all yogīs, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of\nMe within himself, and renders transcendental loving serve to Me-he is the\nmost intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.\" So the\nfirst-class yogī is he who controls his senses and detaches himself from\nmaterial activities by always thinking of the form of the Lord.\nBack to Godhead\nThe Viṣṇudūtas who had rescued Ajāmila came before him again when\nhis mind was firmly fixed upon the form of the Lord. They had gone away\nfor some time to give Ajāmila a chance to become firmly fixed in\nmeditation upon the Lord. Now that his devotion had matured, they\nreturned to take him back to Godhead.

Some devotees go to\nVaikuṇṭha to become associates of Lord Viṣṇu, and others go to Goloka\nVṛndāvana to become associates of Kṛṣṇa.\nSpiritual airplanes from the spiritual planets, like the one that came for\nAjāmila, can take one back home, back to Godhead, in a second. The speed\nof such a spiritual airplane can only be imagined. Spirit is finer than the\nmind, and everyone has experience of how swiftly the mind travels from\none place to another. Therefore one can imagine the swiftness of the\nspiritual form by comparing it to the speed of the mind. In less than even a\nmoment, a perfect devotee can return home, back to Godhead, immediately\nafter giving up his material body.\nSuch perfection is not available to anyone but devotees of the Lord. It\nhas been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, many karmīs,\njñānīs, and yogīs become attached to material activities again. Many so-\ncalled svāmīs and yogīs give up material activities as false (jagan mithyā),\nbut after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening\nhospitals and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the\npublic. Sometimes they participate in politics, although still falsely\ndeclaring themselves sannyāsīs, members of the renounced order. All these\nactivities are illusory aspects of the material world."

The Kṛṣṇa\nconsciousness movement has actually proved this. In the Western countries,\nmany young boys and girls who had been addicted to drugs and who had\nother bad habits, which they could not give up, abandoned all those\npropensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord\nas soon as they joined the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. In other words,\nthis process is the perfect method of atonement for actions performed in the\nmodes of passion and ignorance. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (1.2.19)\nconfirms this:\ntadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ\nkāma-lobhādayaś ca ye\nceta etair anāviddhaṁ\nsthitaṁ sattve prasīdati\nAs a result of acting under the modes of passion and ignorance, one\nbecomes increasingly lusty and greedy, but when one takes to the process of\nchanting and hearing about Kṛṣṇa, one comes to the platform of goodness\nand becomes happy. As he advances in devotional service, all his doubts are\ncompletely \neradicated \n(bhidyate \nhṛdaya-granthiś \nchidyante \nsarva-\nsaṁśayāḥ). Thus the knot of his desire for fruitive activities is cut to pieces.\nAt the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily\nfunctions are disordered. At that time, even one who throughout his life has\npracticed chanting the holy name of the Lord may not be able to chant the\nHare Kṛṣṇa mantra very distinctly. Nevertheless, such a person receives all\nthe benefits of chanting the holy name. While the body is fit, therefore, why\nshould we not chant the holy name of the Lord loudly and distinctly? If a\nperson does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be\nable to properly chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith. In\nconclusion, one who chants the holy name of the Lord constantly is\nguaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt."

Since that is my firm conviction, kindly explain the reasons for these events.\"\nŚrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī replied: My dear king, when the order-carriers of Yamarāja were\nbaffled and defeated by the order-carriers of Viṣṇu, they approached their master, the\ncontroller of Saṁyamanī-purī and master of sinful persons, to tell him of this incident.\nThe Yamadūtas said, \"Our dear lord, how many controllers are there in this material world?\nHow many causes are responsible for manifesting the various results of activities performed\nunder the three modes of material nature?\n\"If in this universe there are many judges who disagree about punishment and reward, their\ncontradictory actions will neutralize one another, and no one will be punished or rewarded.\nOtherwise, if their contradictory acts fail to neutralize one another, everyone will have to be\nboth punished and rewarded. Since there are many different karmīs, or fruitive workers, there\nmay be different judges to give them justice, but just as one central emperor controls different\ndepartmental rulers, there must be one supreme controller to guide all the judges.\n\"The supreme judge must be one, not many. It was our understanding that you are that\nsupreme judge and that you have jurisdiction even over the demigods. Our impression was that\nyou are the master of all living entities, the supreme authority who discriminates between the\npious and impious activities of all human beings.\n\"But now we see that the punishment ordained under your authority is no longer effective,\nsince your order has been transgressed by four wonderful and perfect persons.

In fear, the members of these orders all worship the Supreme Lord\nby offering Him presentations according to their respective activities.\n\"I, Yamarāja; Indra, the King of heaven; Nirṛti; Varuṇa, the god of the waters; Candra, the\nmoon-god; Agni, the fire-god; Lord Śiva; Pavana, the god of the air; Lord Brahmā; Sūrya, the\nsun-god; Viśvāsu; the eight Vasus; the Sādhyas; the Maruts; the Rudras; the Siddhas; and\nMarīci and the other great ṛṣis engaged in maintaining the departmental affairs of the universe,\nas well as the best of the demigods headed by Bṛhaspati and the great sages headed by Bhṛgu,\nare all certainly freed from the influence of the two base material modes of nature, namely\npassion and ignorance.

Only human beings have consciousness of\nright and wrong, and among them only those who perform sinful activities\ncome under the control of Yamarāja.

Whether one is a human being, a demigod, an\nanimal, a tree, or a plant, one is controlled by the laws of nature, and behind\nthis natural control is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kṛṣṇa confirms\nthis in the Bhagavad-gītā (9.10): mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-\ncarācaram. \"The material nature is working under My direction and\nproducing all moving and nonmoving beings.\" Thus the natural machine\nworks under Kṛṣṇa's control.\nUnder the Control of Varṇa and Āśrama\nApart from other living entities, a living being in the human form of\nbody is meant to be controlled by the Vedic injunctions in terms of the\ndivisions of varṇa and āśrama, the social and spiritual classes. Otherwise\nhe cannot escape punishment by Yamarāja. The point is that every human\nbeing is expected to elevate himself to the position of a brāhmaṇa, the most\nintelligent man, and then one must transcend that position to become a\nVaiṣṇava. This is the perfection of life. The brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas,\nand śūdras can elevate themselves by worshiping the Lord according to\ntheir activities (sve sve karmaṇy abhirataḥ saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ). The\ndivisions of varṇa and āśrama are necessary to insure the proper execution\nof duties and peaceful existence for everyone, but everyone is directed to\nworship the Supreme Lord, who is all-pervading (yena sarvam idaṁ tatam).\nIf one thus follows the Vedic injunctions by worshiping the Supreme Lord\naccording to one's ability, his life will be perfect. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam\n(1.2.13) confirms this:\nataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭha\nvarṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ\nsvanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya\nsaṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam"

Such persons are not within my\njurisdiction for punishment. Generally they never commit sinful activities, but even if by\nmistake or because of bewilderment or illusion they sometimes commit sinful acts, they are\nprotected from sinful reactions because they always chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra.\n\"My dear servants, please do not approach such devotees, for they have fully surrendered to\nthe lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

They are always protected by the club of the Supreme Lord, and therefore Lord\nBrahmā and I and even the time factor are not competent to chastise them.\n\"Paramahaṁsas are exalted persons who have no taste for material enjoyment and who drink\nthe honey of the Lord's lotus feet. My dear servants, bring to me for punishment only persons\nwho are averse to the taste of that honey, who do not associate with paramahaṁsas, and who\nare attached to family life and worldly enjoyment, which form the path to hell.\n\"My dear servants, please bring to me only those sinful persons who do not use their tongues to\nchant the holy name and qualities of Kṛṣṇa, whose hearts do not remember the lotus feet of\nKṛṣṇa even once, and whose heads do not bow down even once before Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Yamarāja therefore stated that the Viṣṇudūtas resemble the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead in their bodily features, transcendental\nqualities, and nature. In other words, the Viṣṇudūtas, or Vaiṣṇavas, are\nalmost as qualified as the Supreme Lord. Yamarāja informed the Yamadūtas\nthat the Viṣṇudūtas are no less powerful than Lord Viṣṇu. Since Viṣṇu is\nabove Yamarāja, the Viṣṇudūtas are above the Yamadūtas. Persons\nprotected by the Viṣṇudūtas, therefore, cannot be touched by the\nYamadūtas.\nYamarāja has described the qualities of the Viṣṇudūtas to convince his\nown servants not to be envious of them. Yamarāja warned the Yamadūtas\nthat the Viṣṇudūtas are worshiped with respectful obeisances by the\ndemigods and are always very alert to protect the devotees of the Lord from\nthe hands of enemies, from natural disturbances, and from all dangerous\nconditions in this material world.

Real religious principles are nistraiguṇya, above the three modes of\nmaterial nature, or transcendental. The Yamadūtas did not know these\ntranscendental religious principles, and therefore when prevented from\narresting Ajāmila, they were surprised.\nMaterialistic persons who attach all their faith to the Vedic rituals are\ndescribed in the Bhagavad-gītā (2.42), wherein Kṛṣṇa says, veda-vāda-\nratāḥ pārtha nānyad astīti vādinaḥ: \"The supposed followers of the Vedas\nsay that there is nothing beyond the Vedic ceremonies.\" Indeed, there is a\ngroup of men in India who are very fond of the Vedic rituals, not\nunderstanding the meaning of these rituals, which are intended to elevate\none gradually to the transcendental platform of knowing Kṛṣṇa (vedaiś ca\nsarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. 15.15]).

Lord Kṛṣṇa states that principle in\nthe Bhagavad-gītā (18.66): sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ\nvraja. \"Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me.\" That is the real\nreligious principle everyone should follow. Even though one follows the\nVedic scriptures, one may not know this transcendental principle, for it is\nnot known to everyone. To say nothing of human beings, even the demigods\nin the upper planetary systems are unaware of it. This transcendental\nreligious principle must be understood from the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead directly or from His special representative, as stated in these\nverses.\nIn the Bhagavad-gītā Lord Kṛṣṇa refers to bhāgavata-dharma as the\nmost \nconfidential \nreligious \nprinciple \n(sarva-guhyatamam, \nguhyād\nguhyataram). Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, \"Because you are My very dear friend,\nI am explaining to you the most confidential religion.\" Sarva-dharmān\nparityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja: [Bg. 18.66] \"Give up all other duties\nand surrender unto Me.\" One may ask, If this principle is very rarely\nunderstood, what is the use of it? In answer, Yamarāja states herein that this\nreligious principle is understandable if one follows the paramparā system\nof Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, the four Kumāras, and the other standard\nauthorities. There are four lines of disciplic succession: one from Lord\nBrahmā, one from Lord Śiva, one from Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, and\none from the Kumāras. The disciplic succession from Lord Brahmā is called\nthe Brahma-sampradāya, the succession from Lord Śiva (Śambhu) is called\nthe Rudra-sampradāya, the one from the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmījī, is\ncalled the Śrī-sampradāya, and the one from the Kumāras is called the\nKumāra-sampradāya. One must take shelter of one of these four\nsampradāyas in order to understand the most confidential religious system.\nIn the Padma Purāṇa it is said, sampradāya-vihīnā ye mantras te niṣphalā\nmatāḥ: if one does not follow the four recognized disciplic successions, his\nmantra, or initiation, is useless.\nAt present there are many apasampradāyas, or un–bona fide\nsampradāyas, which have no link to authorities like Lord Brahmā, Lord\nŚiva, the Kumāras, or Lakṣmī.

What are these principles? The Bhāgavatam\n(1.1.2) says, dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra: \"In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam\nthere are no cheating religious systems.\" In other words, everything in the\nBhāgavatam is directly connected with the Supreme Personality of\nGodhead. The Bhāgavatam (1.2.6) further says, sa vai puṁsāṁ paro\ndharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje: \"The supreme religion is that which\nteaches its followers how to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who\nis beyond the reach of experimental knowledge.\" Such a religious system\nbegins with tan-nāma-grahaṇa, chanting the holy name of the Lord. After\nchanting the holy name and dancing in ecstasy, one gradually sees the\ntranscendental form of the Lord, the qualities of the Lord, and the pastimes\nof the Lord. In this way one fully understands the situation of the\nPersonality of Godhead.\nOne can come to this understanding of the Lord, however, only by\nexecuting devotional service. As Kṛṣṇa states in the Bhagavad-gītā (18.55),\nbhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ: \"One can understand\nMe as I am only by devotional service.\" If a person is fortunate enough to\nunderstand the Supreme Lord in this way, the result is that after giving up\nhis material body he no longer has to take birth in this material world\n(tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. 4.9]). Instead, he returns home, back\nto Godhead. That is the ultimate perfection. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the\nBhagavad-gītā (8.15):\nmām upetya punar janma\nduḥkhālayam aśāśvatam\nnāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ\nsaṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ\n\"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogīs in devotion, never return\nto this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have\nattained the highest perfection.\"\nEvidence in Support of Chanting the Holy Name"

Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu\nadvised,\nharer nāma harer nāma\nharer nāmaiva kevalam\nkalau nāsty eva nāsty eva\nnāsty eva gatir anyathā\n[Adi 17.21]\n\"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverance is\nchanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no\nother way. There is no other way.\" (Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa 3.8.126) In this\nage, almost no one can perform all the difficult ritualistic ceremonies for\nbecoming liberated. Therefore all the śāstras and all the ācāryas have\nrecommended that in this age one simply chant the holy name. That will\nbring one all perfection.\nIn the assembly of Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī's father, Haridāsa Ṭhākura\nconfirmed that simply by chanting the Lord's holy name a person is\nliberated, even if he does not chant completely inoffensively. Smārta-\nbrāhmaṇas and Māyāvādīs do not believe that one can achieve liberation in\nthis way, but the truth of Haridāsa Ṭhākura's statement is supported by\nmany quotations from the Vedic literature.\nIn the passage of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam under discussion, for example,\nYamarāja says, \"It should be understood that one is easily relieved from all\nsinful reactions by chanting the holy name of the Lord and chanting His\nqualities and activities. This is the only process recommended for relief\nfrom sinful reactions.\" In his commentary on this verse, Śrīdhara Svāmī\ngives the following quotation: sāyaṁ prātar gṛṇan bhaktyā duḥkha-grāmād\nvimucyate. \"If one continually chants the holy name of the Lord with great\ndevotion morning and evening, one will become free from all material\nmiseries.\" Another quotation confirms that a person can achieve liberation\nif he hears the holy name of the Lord continually, every day, with great\nrespect: anudinam idam ādareṇa śṛṇvan.

Therefore the chanting of the saṅkīrtana\nmovement is the most auspicious activity in the entire universe.\"\nAll these quotations prove that one who constantly engages in chanting\nand hearing the holy name of the Lord, along with descriptions of His fame,\nform, and activities, is liberated. As stated wonderfully in verse 24,\netāvatālam agha-nirharaṇāya puṁsām: simply by uttering the name of the\nLord, one is freed from all sinful reactions.\nThe word alam in this verse indicates that simply uttering the holy name\nof the Lord is sufficient. There is no need of any other process. Even if a\nperson chants imperfectly, he becomes free from all sinful reactions.\nThe liberation of Ajāmila proves this power of chanting the holy name.\nWhen Ajāmila chanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa, he did not precisely\nremember the Supreme Lord; instead, he remembered his own son. At the\ntime of death, Ajāmila certainly was not very clean; indeed, he was famous\nas a great sinner. Furthermore, one's physiological condition is completely\ndisturbed at the time of death, and in such an awkward condition it would\ncertainly have been very difficult for Ajāmila to have chanted clearly."

Then, by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa without\noffenses, one increases his love for Kṛṣṇa. As stated by Lord Caitanya,\npremā pum-artho mahān: one's main concern should be to increase one's\nattachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to increase one's\nlove for Him.\nSince one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy\nname of the Lord, one may ask why there are so many Vedic ritualistic\nceremonies and why people are attracted to them. Yamarāja answers this\nquestion in the passage of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam under discussion.\nUnfortunately, unintelligent people are bewildered by the grandeur of Vedic\nyajñas, and thus they want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed. They want\nVedic mantras chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such\nceremonies. Sometimes we have to observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies\nto please such unintelligent men. In 1975, when we established a large\nKṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple in Vṛndāvana, we were obliged to have Vedic\nceremonies performed by brāhmaṇas because the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana,\nespecially the smārta-brāhmaṇas, would not accept Europeans and\nAmericans as bona fide brāhmaṇas. Thus we had to engage brāhmaṇas to\nperform costly yajñas. As these yajñas were being performed, the members\nof our Society performed saṅkīrtana loudly with mṛdaṅgas, and I\nconsidered the saṅkīrtana more important than the Vedic ritualistic\nceremonies. The ceremonies and the saṅkīrtana were going on\nsimultaneously. The ceremonies were meant for persons interested in Vedic\nrituals for elevation to heavenly planets (jaḍī-kṛta-matir madhu-\npuṣpitāyām), whereas the saṅkīrtana was meant for pure devotees interested\nin pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

If the members of\nour temples in the different parts of the world simply continue saṅkīrtana\nbefore the Deity, especially before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they will\nremain perfect. There is no need of any other performances. Nevertheless,\nto keep oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative\nprinciples are required. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says that although saṅkīrtana is\nsufficient for the perfection of life, worship of the Deity in the temple must\ncontinue so that the devotees may stay clean and pure. Śrīla\nBhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura therefore recommended that one follow\nboth processes simultaneously. We strictly follow his principle of\nperforming Deity worship and saṅkīrtana along parallel lines. This we\nshould continue.\nThe Jurisdiction of Yamarāja\nIn this regard, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura quotes the following\nverse from the prayers of Lord Brahmā (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 10.14.29):\nathāpī te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-\nprasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi\njānāti tattvaṁ bhagavan-mahimno\nna cānya eko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan\nThe purport is that even though one is a very learned scholar of the Vedic\nśāstras, he may be completely unaware of the existence of the Supreme\nPersonality of Godhead and His name, fame, qualities, and so forth,\nwhereas one who is not a great scholar can understand the position of the\nSupreme Personality of Godhead if he somehow or other becomes a pure\ndevotee of the Lord by engaging in devotional service. Therefore in verse\n26 Yamarāja says, evaṁ vimṛśya sudhiyo bhagavati: those who engage in\nthe loving service of the Lord become sudhiyaḥ, intelligent, but this is not\nso of a Vedic scholar who does not understand Kṛṣṇa's name, fame, and\nqualities.
