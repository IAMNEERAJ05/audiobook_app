  "chapter_title": "Chapter 2: In Imitation Of the Original",
  "summary": "In this poignant chapter, we witness Ajāmila's tragic decline, an eighty-eight-year-old soul entangled in sin, yet clinging desperately to the earthly affection for his youngest son, Nārāyaṇa. This deep, instinctual parental love, we learn, is but a poignant reflection – a distorted echo – of the pure, original affection found only in the spiritual realm. The narrative delves into the profound truth that all variety and emotion originate from the Supreme Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa, who is far from an impersonal void. We are led to understand the folly of those who deny God's spiritual form, mistaking His divine, human-like pastimes for mere earthly acts. Even mighty Brahmā and Indra were once bewildered by Kṛṣṇa's child-like wonders – the lifting of Govardhana Hill, the expansion into calves and boys – only to surrender to His unparalleled, eternal divinity. This chapter powerfully asserts that the Supreme is a supremely conscious, all-knowing source of infinite knowledge and bliss, whose reality encompasses all love in its purest, most transcendental state.",
