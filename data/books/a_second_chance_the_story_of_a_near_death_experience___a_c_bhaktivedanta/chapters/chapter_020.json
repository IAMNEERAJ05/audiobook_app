  "chapter_title": "Chapter 4: Neither Birth Nor Death",
  "summary": "As Ajāmila lay dying, a chilling dread seized him. Three fearsome beings, Yamadūtas with twisted faces and ropes, loomed into his vision, ready to drag his sinful soul to judgment. In that moment of utter terror, his heart cried out not to the divine, but to his young son, 'Nārāyaṇa!' Yet, by that very utterance, a miracle unfolded. The celestial Viṣṇudūtas, messengers of the Supreme Lord, instantly appeared, drawn by the sheer power of the holy name, even if spoken without intention.\n\nThis chapter unveils a profound truth: the mere remembrance of the Lord, however accidental or even borne of enmity, holds the key to liberation. It illuminates that neither birth nor death truly touches the eternal soul, nor does it affect the divine Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotees. While others may fear the transition, devotees are carried safely, like kittens in a mother's mouth, to Kṛṣṇa's eternal abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, where the pains of this world vanish forever. It is a testament to the boundless mercy that transcends even a lifetime of misdeeds, offering solace and liberation to any soul touched by the Lord’s sacred name.",
