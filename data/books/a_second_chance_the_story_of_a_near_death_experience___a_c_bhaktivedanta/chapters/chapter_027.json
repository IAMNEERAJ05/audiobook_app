  "summary": "Chapter 6 opens with a dramatic, breathtaking intervention as the dark agents of Yamarāja, poised to seize Ajāmila’s soul, are suddenly confronted. Standing before them are luminous, four-armed beings, radiating a celestial beauty never before witnessed in the material realm. Clad in vibrant yellow silks, adorned with lotus garlands, and holding divine weapons, these enigmatic figures emanate an effulgence that dispels all earthly darkness.\n\nThe bewildered Yamadūtas, accustomed to unchallenged authority, question these glorious intruders. Who are they? From whence do they hail? They are, in fact, the Viṣṇudūtas, emissaries from the spiritual sky, Vaikuṇṭha – a realm of unparalleled splendor, existing far beyond our material comprehension. Here, souls reside in eternal liberation, bearing the very form of the Lord, yet eternally serving Him. This astonishing encounter not only halts Ajāmila’s fate but unveils a glimpse into a higher reality, where divine grace transcends mortal judgment, hinting at a profound truth awaiting revelation.",
