  "chapter_title": "Chapter 5: The Viṣṇudūtas To the Rescue",
  "summary": "As life ebbed from the dying Ajāmila, the grim Yamadūtas, relentless reapers of karma, arrived to snatch his soul from the very core of his heart. In his final, desperate moments, Ajāmila cried out, not for the Lord, but for his beloved youngest son, 'Nārāyaṇa!' Yet, this heartfelt plea, though born of attachment to his child, carried the most potent of names—the name of Lord Viṣṇu Himself. Instantly, as if summoned by an unseen, profound mercy, the resplendent Viṣṇudūtas, Lord Viṣṇu's own divine messengers, materialized. Their presence radiated an undeniable spiritual authority. With voices that resonated like thunder, they confronted the stunned Yamadūtas, unequivocally forbidding them from touching Ajāmila. 'Stop!' they commanded, their words a shield against the forces of death. For in uttering that sacred name, even inadvertently, Ajāmila had connected with the Supreme Lord, activating a protective grace that defied all sinful reactions. His past good fortune and the absolute power of the holy name had delivered him from hell's grasp, securing his salvation and silencing the claims of death's agents—a profound testament to divine love.",
