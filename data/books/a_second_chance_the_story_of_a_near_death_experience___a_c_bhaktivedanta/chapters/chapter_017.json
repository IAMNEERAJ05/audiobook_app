  "summary": "As life's final curtain began to descend upon old Ajāmila, his world had tragically shrunk to the tender form of his youngest son, Nārāyaṇa. Blinded by a doting, all-consuming attachment, he spent his last precious moments immersed in the child’s innocent babble and awkward steps, his lips ceaselessly calling out the beloved name: Nārāyaṇa. Unbeknownst to him, this was no mere paternal devotion; it was an echo of the divine, a sacred utterance resonating through his very being. At the critical threshold of death, still desperately calling for his son, Ajāmila’s consciousness was inadvertently, miraculously drawn to the holy name of God, a name he had once revered in his youth before his spiritual decline. The immense, purifying power of ‘Nārāyaṇa,’ even invoked without explicit spiritual intent, cleansed his soul, granting him liberation. This poignant tale profoundly illustrates that our state of mind at death, meticulously molded by our life’s focus, dictates our ultimate destiny. It urgently reminds us to transcend fleeting material bonds and cultivate a constant, loving remembrance of the divine, ensuring our passage to eternal peace rather than further worldly entanglement.",
