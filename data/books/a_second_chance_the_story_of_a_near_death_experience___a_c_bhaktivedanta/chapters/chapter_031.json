  "chapter_title": "Chapter 7: Authorized Discrimination",
  "summary": "Chapter Seven opens with a profound and pivotal confrontation. The majestic Viṣṇudūtas, radiating serene authority, encounter the bewildered messengers of death, the Yamadūtas. With voices like deep, resonant clouds, the Viṣṇudūtas issue a challenge: 'If you truly serve Dharmarāja, then tell us—what precisely defines religion and irreligion? And who, amongst all beings, is truly marked for punishment?'\n\nA palpable tension fills the air as the Yamadūtas are exposed, their understanding of their master’s deepest principles incomplete. The Viṣṇudūtas then reveal the essential, startling truth: that genuine religion is unwavering, selfless surrender to the Supreme Lord, Krishna. All other paths, born of material entanglement, are but shadows of true dharma, leading only to suffering. This chapter unveils the precise, authorized discrimination of the divine—a powerful, unwavering truth that separates the deluded from those pure souls who find ultimate liberation in selfless, loving service.",
