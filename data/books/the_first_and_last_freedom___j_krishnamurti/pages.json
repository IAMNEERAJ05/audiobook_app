    "text": "F O R E W O R D \n \nMan is an amphibian who lives simultaneously in two worlds—the given and the \nhome-made, the world of matter, life and consciousness and the world of \nsymbols. In our thinking we make use of a great variety of symbol-systems—\nlinguistic, mathematical, pictorial, musical, ritualistic. Without such symbol-\nsystems we should have no art, no science, no law, no philosophy, not so much \nas the rudiments of civilization: in other words, we should be animals. \nSymbols, then, are indispensable. But symbols—as the history of our own \nand every other age makes so abundantly clear—can also be fatal. Consider, for \nexample, the domain of science on the one hand, the domain of politics and \nreligion on the other. Thinking in terms of, and acting in response to, one set of \nsymbols, we have come, in some small measure, to understand and control the \nelementary forces of nature. Thinking in terms of, and acting in response to, \nanother set of symbols, we use these forces as instruments of mass murder and \ncollective suicide. In the first case the explanatory symbols were well chosen, \ncarefully analysed and progressively adapted to the emergent facts of physical \nexistence. In the second case symbols originally ill-chosen were never subjected \nto thoroughgoing analysis and never reformulated so as to harmonize with the \nemergent facts of human existence. Worse still, these misleading symbols were \neverywhere treated with a wholly unwarranted respect, as though, in some \nmysterious way, they were more real than the realities to which they referred. In \nthe contexts of religion and politics, words are not regarded as standing, rather \ninadequately, for things and events; on the contrary, things and events are \nregarded as particular illustrations of words. \nUp to the present symbols have been used realistically only in those fields \nwhich we do not feel to be supremely important. In every situation involving our \ndeeper impulses we have insisted on using symbols, not merely unrealistically, \nbut idolatrously, even insanely. The result is that we have been able to commit, in \ncold blood and over long periods of time, acts of which the brutes are capable \nonly for brief moments and at the frantic height of rage, desire or fear. Because \nthey use and worship symbols, men can become idealists; and, being idealists, \nthey can transform the animal’s intermittent greed into the grandiose \nimperialisms of a Rhodes or a J. P. Morgan; the animal’s intermittent love of \nbullying into Stalinism or the Spanish Inquisition; the animal’s intermittent \nattachment to its territory into the calculated frenzies of nationalism. Happily, \nthey can also transform the animal’s intermittent kindliness into the lifelong \ncharity of an Elizabeth Fry or a Vincent de Paul; the animal’s intermittent \ndevotion to its mate and its young into that reasoned and persistent cooperation \nwhich, up to the present, has proved strong enough to save the world from the \nconsequences of the other, the disastrous kind of idealism. Will it go on being \nable to save the world? The question cannot be answered. All we can say is that, \nwith the idealists of nationalism holding the A-bomb, the odds in favour of the \nidealists of cooperation and charity have sharply declined. \nEven the best cookery book is no substitute for even the worst dinner. The \nfact seems sufficiently obvious. And yet, throughout the ages, the most profound"

    "text": "philosophers, the most learned and acute theologians have constantly fallen into \nthe error of identifying their purely verbal constructions with facts, or into the yet \nmore enormous error of imagining that symbols are somehow more real than \nwhat they stand for. Their word-worship did not go without protest. “Only the \nspirit,” said St. Paul, “gives life; the letter kills.” “And why,” asks Eckhart, “why \ndo you prate of God? Whatever you say of God is untrue.” At the other end of \nthe world the author of one of the Mahayana sutras affirmed that “the truth was \nnever preached by the Buddha, seeing that you have to realize it within yourself”. \nSuch utterances were felt to be profoundly subversive, and respectable people \nignored them. The strange idolatrous overestimation of words and emblems \ncontinued unchecked. Religions declined; but the old habit of formulating creeds \nand imposing belief in dogmas persisted even among the atheists. \nIn recent years logicians and semanticists have carried out a very thorough \nanalysis of the symbols, in terms of which men do their thinking. Linguistics has \nbecome a science, and one may even study a subject to which the late Benjamin \nWhorf gave the name of metalinguistics. All this is greatly to the good; but it is \nnot enough. Logic and semantics, linguistics and metalinguistics—these are \npurely intellectual disciplines. They analyse the various ways, correct and \nincorrect, meaningful and meaningless, in which words can be related to things, \nprocesses and events. But they offer no guidance, in regard to the much more \nfundamental problem of the relationship of man in his psychophysical totality, on \nthe one hand, and his two worlds, of data and of symbols, on the other. \nIn every region and at every period of history, the problem has been \nrepeatedly solved by individual men and women. Even when they spoke or \nwrote, these individuals created no systems—for they knew that every system is \na standing temptation to take symbols too seriously, to pay more attention to \nwords than to the realities for which the words are supposed to stand. Their aim \nwas never to offer ready-made explanations and panaceas; it was to induce \npeople to diagnose and cure their own ills, to get them to go to the place where \nman’s problem and its solution present themselves directly to experience. \nIn this volume of selections from the writings and recorded talks of \nKrishnamurti, the reader will find a clear contemporary statement of the \nfundamental human problem, together with an invitation to solve it in the only \nway in which it can be solved—for and by himself. The collective solutions, to \nwhich so many so desperately pin their faith, are never adequate. “To understand \nthe misery and confusion that exist within ourselves, and so in the world, we \nmust first find clarity within ourselves, and that clarity comes about through right \nthinking. This clarity is not to be organized, for it cannot be exchanged with \nanother. Organized group thought is merely repetitive. Clarity is not the result of \nverbal assertion, but of intense self-awareness and right thinking. Right thinking \nis not the outcome of or mere cultivation of the intellect, nor is it conformity to \npattern, however worthy and noble. Right thinking comes with self-knowledge. \nWithout understanding yourself, you have no basis for thought; without self-\nknowledge, what you think is not true.” \nThis fundamental theme is developed by Krishnamurti in passage after \npassage. “There is hope in men, not in society, not in systems, organized"

    "text": "religious systems, but in you and in me.” Organized religions, with their \nmediators, their sacred books, their dogmas, their hierarchies and rituals, offer \nonly a false solution to the basic problem. “When you quote the Bhagavad Gita, \nor the Bible, or some Chinese Sacred Book, surely you are merely repeating, are \nyou not? And what you are repeating is not the truth. It is a lie; for truth cannot \nbe repeated.” A lie can be extended, propounded and repeated, but not truth; and \nwhen you repeat truth, it ceases to be truth, and therefore sacred books are \nunimportant. It is through self-knowledge, not through belief in somebody else’s \nsymbols, that a man comes to the eternal reality, in which his being is grounded. \nBelief in the complete adequacy and superlative value of any given symbol-\nsystem leads not to liberation, but to history, to more of the same old disasters. \n“Belief inevitably separates. If you have a belief, or when you seek security in \nyour particular belief, you become separated from those who seek security in \nsome other form of belief. All organized beliefs are based on separation, though \nthey may preach brotherhood.” The man who has successfully solved the \nproblem of his relations with the two worlds of data and symbols, is a man who \nhas no beliefs. With regard to the problems of practical life he entertains a series \nof working hypotheses, which serve his purposes, but are taken no more \nseriously than any other kind of tool or instrument. With regard to his fellow \nbeings and to the reality in which they are grounded, he has the direct \nexperiences of love and insight. It is to protect himself from beliefs that \nKrishnamurti has “not read any sacred literature, neither the Bhagavad Gita nor \nthe Upanishads”. The rest of us do not even read sacred literature; we read our \nfavourite newspapers, magazines and detective stories. This means that we \napproach the crisis of our times, not with love and insight, but “with formulas, \nwith systems”—and pretty poor formulas and systems at that. But “men of good \nwill should not have formulas; for formulas lead, inevitably, only to “blind \nthinking”. Addiction to formulas is almost universal. Inevitably so; for “our \nsystem of upbringing is based upon what to think, not on how to think”. We are \nbrought up as believing and practising members of some organization—the \nCommunist or the Christian, the Moslem, the Hindu, the Buddhist, the Freudian. \nConsequently “you respond to the challenge, which is always new, according to \nan old pattern; and therefore your response has no corresponding validity, \nnewness, freshness. If you respond as a Catholic or a Communist, you are \nresponding—are you not?—according to a patterned thought. Therefore your \nresponse has no significance. And has not the Hindu, the Mussulman, the \nBuddhist, the Christian created this problem? As the new religion is the worship \nof the State, so the old religion was the worship of an idea.” If you respond to a \nchallenge according to the old conditioning, your response will not enable you to \nunderstand the new challenge. Therefore what “one has to do, in order to meet \nthe new challenge, is to strip oneself completely, denude oneself entirely of the \nbackground and meet the challenge anew”. In other words symbols should never \nbe raised to the rank of dogmas, nor should any system be regarded as more than \na provisional convenience. Belief in formulas and action in accordance with \nthese beliefs cannot bring us to a solution of our problem. “It is only through \ncreative understanding of ourselves that there can be a creative world, a happy"

    "text": "world, a world in which ideas do not exist.” A world in which ideas do not exist \nwould be a happy world, because it would be a world without the powerful \nconditioning forces which compel men to undertake inappropriate action, a world \nwithout the hallowed dogmas in terms of which the worst crimes are justified, the \ngreatest follies elaborately rationalized. \nAn education that teaches us not how but what to think is an education that \ncalls for a governing class of pastors and masters. But “the very idea of leading \nsomebody is anti-social and anti-spiritual”. To the man who exercises it, \nleadership brings gratification of the craving for power; to those who are led, it \nbrings the gratification of the desire for certainty and security. The guru provides \na kind of dope. But, it may be asked, “What are you doing? Are you not acting as \nour guru?” “Surely,” Krishnamurti answers, “I am not acting as your guru, \nbecause, first of all, I am not giving you any gratification. I am not telling you \nwhat you should do from moment to moment, or from day to day, but I am just \npointing out something to you; you can take it or leave it, depending on you, not \non me. I do not demand a thing from you, neither your worship, nor your flattery, \nnor your insults, nor your gods. I say, This is a fact; take it or leave it. And most \nof you will leave it, for the obvious reason that you do not find gratification in \nit.” \nWhat is it precisely that Krishnamurti offers? What is it that we can take if we \nwish, but in all probability shall prefer to leave? It is not, as we have seen, a \nsystem of beliefs, a catalogue of dogmas, a set of ready-made notions and ideals. \nIt is not leadership, not mediation, not spiritual direction, not even example. It is \nnot ritual, not a church, not a code, not uplift or any form of inspirational \ntwaddle. \nIs it, perhaps, self-discipline? No; for self-discipline is not, as a matter of \nbrute fact, the way in which our problem can be solved. In order to find the \nsolution, the mind must open itself to reality, must confront the givenness of the \nouter and inner worlds without preconceptions or restrictions. (God’s service is \nperfect freedom. Conversely, perfect freedom is the service of God.) In becoming \ndisciplined, the mind undergoes no radical change; it is the old self, but \n“tethered, held in control”. \nSelf-discipline joins the list of things which Krishnamurti does not offer. Can \nit be, then, that what he offers is prayer? Again, the reply is in the negative. \n“Prayer may bring you the answer you seek; but that answer may come from \nyour unconscious, or from the general reservoir, the storehouse of all your \ndemands. The answer is not the still voice of God.” Consider, Krishnamurti goes \non, “what happens when you pray. By constant repetition of certain phrases, and \nby controlling your thoughts, the mind becomes quiet, doesn’t it? At least, the \nconscious mind becomes quiet. You kneel as the Christians do, or you sit as the \nHindus do, and you repeat and repeat, and through that repetition the mind \nbecomes quiet. In that quietness there is the intimation of something. That \nintimation of something, for which you have prayed, may be from the \nunconscious, or it may be the response of your memories. But, surely, it is not the \nvoice of reality; for the voice of reality must come to you; it cannot be appealed \nto, you cannot pray to it. You cannot entice it into your little cage by doing puja,"

Once you have learned the trick of quietening the \nmind, through the repetition of words, and of receiving hints in that quietness, the \ndanger is—unless you are fully alert as to whence those hints come—that you \nwill be caught, and then prayer becomes a substitute for the search for Truth. \nThat which you ask for you get; but it is not the truth. If you want, and if you \npetition, you will receive, but you will pay for it in the end.” \nFrom prayer we pass to yoga, and yoga, we find, is another of the things \nwhich Krishnamurti does not offer. For yoga is concentration, and concentration \nis exclusion. “You build a wall of resistance by concentration on a thought which \nyou have chosen, and you try to ward off all the others.” What is commonly \ncalled meditation is merely “the cultivation of resistance, of exclusive \nconcentration on an idea of our choice”. But what makes you choose? “What \nmakes you say this is good, true, noble, and the rest is not? Obviously the choice \nis based on pleasure, reward or achievement; or it is merely a reaction of one’s \nconditioning or tradition. Why do you choose at all? Why not examine every \nthought? When you are interested in the many, why choose one? Why not \nexamine every interest? Instead of creating resistance, why not go into each \ninterest as it arises, and not merely concentrate on one idea, one interest? After \nall, you are made up of many interests, you have many masks, consciously and \nunconsciously. Why choose one and discard all the others, in combating which \nyou spend all your energies, thereby creating resistance, conflict and friction. \nWhereas if you consider every thought as it arises—every thought, not just a few \nthoughts—then there is no exclusion. But it is an arduous thing to examine every \nthought. Because, as you are looking at one thought, another slips in. But if you \nare aware without domination or justification, you will see that, by merely \nlooking at that thought, no other thought intrudes. It is only when you condemn, \ncompare, approximate, that other thoughts enter in.” \n“Judge not that ye be not judged.” The gospel precept applies to our dealings \nwith ourselves no less than to our dealings with others. Where there is \njudgement, where there is comparison and condemnation, openness of mind is \nabsent; there can be no freedom from the tyranny of symbols and systems, no \nescape from the past and the environment. Introspection with a predetermined \npurpose, self-examination within the framework of some traditional code, some \nset of hallowed postulates—these do not, these cannot help us. There is a \ntranscendent spontaneity of life, a ‘creative Reality’, as Krishnamurti calls it, \nwhich reveals itself as immanent only when the perceiver’s mind is in a state of \n‘alert passivity’, of ‘choiceless awareness’. Judgement and comparison commit \nus irrevocably to duality. Only choiceless awareness can lead to non-duality, to \nthe reconciliation of opposites in a total understanding and a total love. Ama et \nfac quod vis. If you love, you may do what you will. But if you start by doing \nwhat you will, or by doing what you don’t will in obedience to some traditional \nsystem or notions, ideals and prohibitions, you will never love. The liberating \nprocess must begin with the choiceless awareness of what you will and of your \nreactions to the symbol-system which tells you that you ought, or ought not, to \nwill it. Through this choiceless awareness, as it penetrates the successive layers"

This choiceless \nawareness—at every moment and in all the circumstances of life—is the only \neffective meditation. All other forms of yoga lead either to the blind thinking \nwhich results from self-discipline, or to some kind of self-induced rapture, some \nform of false samadhi. The true liberation is “an inner freedom of creative \nReality”. This “is not a gift; it is to be discovered and experienced. It is not an \nacquisition to be gathered to yourself to glorify yourself. It is a state of being, as \nsilence, in which there is no becoming, in which there is completeness. This \ncreativeness may not necessarily seek expression; it is not a talent that demands \noutward manifestation. You need not be a great artist or have an audience; if you \nseek these, you will miss the inward Reality. It is neither a gift, nor is it the \noutcome of talent; it is to be found, this imperishable treasure, where thought \nfrees itself from lust, ill will and ignorance, where thought frees itself from \nworldliness and personal craving to be. It is to be experienced through right \nthinking and meditation.” Choiceless self-awareness will bring us to the creative \nReality which underlies all our destructive make-believes, to the tranquil wisdom \nwhich is always there, in spite of ignorance, in spite of the knowledge which is \nmerely ignorance in another form. Knowledge is an affair of symbols and is, all \ntoo often, a hindrance to wisdom, to the uncovering of the self from moment to \nmoment. A mind that has come to the stillness of wisdom “shall know being, \nshall know what it is to love. Love is neither personal nor impersonal. Love is \nlove, not to be defined or described by the mind as exclusive or inclusive. Love is \nits own eternity; it is the real, the supreme, the immeasurable.”"

I may use words that may have to you a significance different \nfrom mine. Understanding comes when we, you and I, meet on the same level at \nthe same time. That happens only when there is real affection between people, \nbetween husband and wife, between intimate friends. That is real communion. \nInstantaneous understanding comes when we meet on the same level at the same \ntime. \nIt is very difficult to commune with one another easily, effectively and with \ndefinitive action. I am using words which are simple, which are not technical, \nbecause I do not think that any technical type of expression is going to help us \nsolve our difficult problems; so I am not going to use any technical terms, either \nof psychology or of science. I have not read any books on psychology or any \nreligious books, fortunately. I would like to convey, by the very simple words \nwhich we use in our daily life, a deeper significance; but that is very difficult if \nyou do not know how to listen. \nThere is an art of listening. To be able really to listen, one should abandon or \nput aside all prejudices, preformulations and daily activities. When you are in a \nreceptive state of mind, things can be easily understood; you are listening when \nyour real attention is given to something. But unfortunately most of us listen \nthrough a screen of resistance. We are screened with prejudices, whether \nreligious or spiritual, psychological or scientific; or with our daily worries, \ndesires and fears. And with these for a screen, we listen. Therefore, we listen \nreally to our own noise, to our own sound, not to what is being said. It is \nextremely difficult to put aside our training, our prejudices, our inclination, our \nresistance, and, reaching beyond the verbal expression, to listen so that we \nunderstand instantaneously. That is going to be one of our difficulties. \nIf, during this discourse, anything is said which is opposed to your way of \nthinking and belief, just listen; do not resist. You may be right, and I may be \nwrong; but by listening and considering together we are going to find out what is \nthe truth. Truth cannot be given to you by somebody. You have to discover it; \nand to discover, there must be a state of mind in which there is direct perception. \nThere is no direct perception when there is a resistance, a safeguard, a protection. \nUnderstanding comes through being aware of what is. To know exactly what is, \nthe real, the actual, without interpreting it, without condemning or justifying it, \nis, surely, the beginning of wisdom. It is only when we begin to interpret, to \ntranslate according to our conditioning, according to our prejudice, that we miss \nthe truth. After all, it is like research. To know what something is, what it is \nexactly, requires research—you cannot translate it according to your moods. \nSimilarly, if we can look, observe, listen, be aware of what is, exactly, then the \nproblem is solved. And that is what we are going to do in all these discourses. I \nam going to point out to you what is, and not translate it according to my fancy; \nnor should you translate it or interpret it according to your background or \ntraining."

    "text": "Is it not possible, then, to be aware of everything as it is? Starting from there, \nsurely, there can be an understanding. To acknowledge, to be aware of, to get at \nthat which is, puts an end to struggle. If I know that I am a liar, and it is a fact \nwhich I recognize, then the struggle is over. To acknowledge, to be aware of \nwhat one is, is already the beginning of wisdom, the beginning of understanding, \nwhich releases you from time. To bring in the quality of time—time, not in the \nchronological sense, but as the medium, as the psychological process, the process \nof the mind—is destructive, and creates confusion. \nSo, we can have understanding of what is when we recognize it without \ncondemnation, without justification, without identification. To know that one is \nin a certain condition, in a certain state, is already a process of liberation; but a \nman who is not aware of his condition, of his struggle, tries to be something other \nthan he is, which brings about habit. So, then, let us keep in mind that we want to \nexamine what is, to observe and be aware of exactly what is the actual, without \ngiving it any slant, without giving it an interpretation. It needs an extraordinarily \nastute mind, an extraordinarily pliable heart, to be aware of and to follow what is; \nbecause what is is constantly moving, constantly undergoing a transformation, \nand if the mind is tethered to belief, to knowledge, it ceases to pursue, it ceases to \nfollow the swift movement of what is. What is is not static, surely—it is \nconstantly moving, as you will see if you observe it very closely. To follow it, \nyou need a very swift mind and a pliable heart—which are denied when the mind \nis static, fixed in a belief, in a prejudice, in an identification; and a mind and \nheart that are dry cannot follow easily, swiftly, that which is. \nOne is aware, I think, without too much discussion, too much verbal \nexpression, that there is individual as well as collective chaos, confusion and \nmisery. It is not only in India, but right throughout the world; in China, America, \nEngland, Germany, all over the world, there is confusion, mounting sorrow. It is \nnot only national, it is not particularly here, it is all over the world. There is \nextraordinarily acute suffering, and it is not individual only but collective. So it is \na world catastrophe, and to limit it merely to a geographical area, a coloured \nsection of the map, is absurd; because then we shall not understand the full \nsignificance of this worldwide as well as individual suffering. Being aware of \nthis confusion, what is our response today? How do we react? \nThere is suffering, political, social, religious; our whole psychological being \nis confused, and all the leaders, political and religious, have failed us; all the \nbooks have lost their significance. You may go to the Bhagavad Gita or the Bible \nor the latest treatise on politics or psychology, and you will find that they have \nlost that ring, that quality of truth; they have become mere words. You yourself, \nwho are the repeater of those words, are confused and uncertain, and mere \nrepetition of words conveys nothing. Therefore the words and the books have lost \ntheir value; that is, if you quote the Bible, or Marx, or the Bhagavad Gita, as you \nwho quote it are yourself uncertain, confused, your repetition becomes a lie; \nbecause what is written there becomes mere propaganda, and propaganda is not \ntruth. So when you repeat, you have ceased to understand your own state of \nbeing. You are merely covering with words of authority your own confusion.

We read \nbooks but we never write books. It has become our tradition, our national and \nuniversal habit, to be the spectators, to look on at a football game, to watch the \npublic politicians and orators. We are merely the outsiders, looking on, and we \nhave lost the creative capacity. Therefore we want to absorb and partake. \nBut if you are merely observing, if you are merely spectators, you will lose \nentirely the significance of this discourse, because this is not a lecture which you \nare to listen to from force of habit. I am not going to give you information which \nyou can pick up in an encyclopaedia. What we are trying to do is to follow each \nother’s thoughts, to pursue as far as we can, as profoundly as we can, the \nintimations, the responses of our own feelings. So please find out what your \nresponse is to this cause, to this suffering; not what somebody else’s words are, \nbut how you yourself respond. Your response is one of indifference if you benefit \nby the suffering, by the chaos, if you derive profit from it, either economic, \nsocial, political or psychological. Therefore you do not mind if this chaos \ncontinues. Surely, the more trouble there is in the world, the more chaos, the \nmore one seeks security. Haven’t you noticed it? When there is confusion in the \nworld, psychologically and in every way, you enclose yourself in some kind of \nsecurity, either that of a bank account or that of an ideology; or else you turn to \nprayer, you go to the temple—which is really escaping from what is happening in \nthe world. More and more sects are being formed, more and more ‘isms’ are \nspringing up all over the world. Because the more confusion there is, the more \nyou want a leader, somebody who will guide you out of this mess, so you turn to \nthe religious books, or to one of the latest teachers; or else you act and respond \naccording to a system which appears to solve the problem, a system either of the \nleft or of the right. That is exactly what is happening. \nThe moment you are aware of confusion, of exactly what is, you try to escape \nfrom it. Those sects which offer you a system for the solution of suffering, \neconomic, social or religious, are the worst; because then system becomes \nimportant and not man—whether it be a religious system, or a system of the left \nor of the right. System becomes important, the philosophy, the idea, becomes \nimportant, and not man; and for the sake of the idea, of the ideology, you are \nwilling to sacrifice all mankind, which is exactly what is happening in the world. \nThis is not merely my interpretation; if you observe, you will find that is exactly \nwhat is happening. The system has become important. Therefore, as the system \nhas become important, men, you and I, lose significance; and the controllers of \nthe system, whether religious or social, whether of the left or of the right, assume \nauthority, assume power, and therefore sacrifice you, the individual. That is \nexactly what is happening. \nNow what is the cause of this confusion, this misery?

What happens when we have no other values except the value of the \nthings of the senses, the value of the products of the mind, of the hand or of the \nmachine? The more significance we give to the sensual value of things, the \ngreater the confusion, is it not? Again, this is not my theory. You do not have to \nquote books to find out that your values, your riches, your economic and social \nexistence are based on things made by the hand or by the mind. So we live and \nfunction and have our being steeped in sensual values, which means that things, \nthe things of the mind, the things of the hand and of the machine, have become \nimportant; and when things become important, belief becomes predominantly \nsignificant—which is exactly what is happening in the world, is it not? \nThus, giving more and more significance to the values of the senses brings \nabout confusion; and, being in confusion, we try to escape from it through \nvarious forms, whether religious, economic or social, or through ambition, \nthrough power, through the search for reality. But the real is near, you do not \nhave to seek it; and a man who seeks truth will never find it. Truth is in what is—\nand that is the beauty of it. But the moment you conceive it, the moment you \nseek it, you begin to struggle; and a man who struggles cannot understand. That \nis why we have to be still, observant, passively aware. We see that our living, our \naction, is always within the field of destruction, within the field of sorrow; like a \nwave, confusion and chaos always overtake us. There is no interval in the \nconfusion of existence. \nWhatever we do at present seems to lead to chaos, seems to lead to sorrow \nand unhappiness. Look at your own life and you will see that our living is always \non the border of sorrow. Our work, our social activity, our politics, the various \ngatherings of nations to stop war, all produce further war. Destruction follows in \nthe wake of living; whatever we do leads to death. That is what is actually taking \nplace. \nCan we stop this misery at once, and not go on always being caught by the \nwave of confusion and sorrow? That is, great teachers, whether the Buddha or the \nChrist, have come; they have accepted faith, making themselves, perhaps, free \nfrom confusion and sorrow. But they have never prevented sorrow, they have \nnever stopped confusion. Confusion goes on, sorrow goes on. If you, seeing this \nsocial and economic confusion, this chaos, this misery, withdraw into what is \ncalled the religious life and abandon the world, you may feel that you are joining \nthese great teachers; but the world goes on with its chaos, its misery and \ndestruction, the everlasting suffering of its rich and poor. So, our problem, yours \nand mine, is whether we can step out of this misery instantaneously. If, living in \nthe world, you refuse to be a part of it, you will help others out of this chaos—not \nin the future, not tomorrow, but now. Surely that is our problem. War is probably \ncoming, more destructive, more appalling in its form. Surely we cannot prevent \nit, because the issues are much too strong and too close. But you and I can \nperceive the confusion and misery immediately, can we not? We must perceive \nthem, and then we shall be in a position to awaken the same understanding of \ntruth in another. In other words, can you be instantaneously free?—because that \nis the only way out of this misery. Perception can take place only in the present;"

    "text": "but if you say, “I will do it tomorrow”, the wave of confusion overtakes you, and \nyou are then always involved in confusion. \nNow is it possible to come to that state when you yourself perceive the truth \ninstantaneously and therefore put an end to confusion? I say that it is, and that it \nis the only possible way. I say it can be done and must be done, not based on \nsupposition or belief. To bring about this extraordinary revolution—which is not \nthe revolution to get rid of the capitalists and install another group—to bring \nabout this wonderful transformation, which is the only true revolution, is the \nproblem. What is generally called revolution is merely the modification or the \ncontinuance of the right according to the ideas of the left. The left, after all, is the \ncontinuation of the right in a modified form. If the right is based on sensual \nvalues, the left is but a continuance of the same sensual values, different only in \ndegree or expression. Therefore true revolution can take place only when you, \nthe individual, become aware in your relationship to another. Surely what you are \nin your relationship to another, to your wife, your child, your boss, your \nneighbour, is society. Society by itself is non-existent. Society is what you and I, \nin our relationship, have created; it is the outward projection of all our own \ninward psychological states. So if you and I do not understand ourselves, merely \ntransforming the outer, which is the projection of the inner, has no significance \nwhatsoever; that is there can be no significant alteration or modification in \nsociety so long as I do not understand myself in relationship to you. Being \nconfused in my relationship, I create a society which is the replica, the outward \nexpression of what I am. This is an obvious fact, which we can discuss. We can \ndiscuss whether society, the outward expression, has produced me, or whether I \nhave produced society. \nIs it not, therefore, an obvious fact that what I am in my relationship to \nanother creates society and that, without radically transforming myself, there can \nbe no transformation of the essential function of society? When we look to a \nsystem for the transformation of society, we are merely evading the question, \nbecause a system cannot transform man; man always transforms the system, \nwhich history shows. Until I, in my relationship to you, understand myself, I am \nthe cause of chaos, misery, destruction, fear, brutality. Understanding myself is \nnot a matter of time; I can understand myself at this very moment. If I say, “I \nshall understand myself tomorrow”, I am bringing in chaos and misery, my \naction is destructive. The moment I say that I “shall” understand, I bring in the \ntime element and so am already caught up in the wave of confusion and \ndestruction. Understanding is now, not tomorrow. Tomorrow is for the lazy \nmind, the sluggish mind, the mind that is not interested. When you are interested \nin something, you do it instantaneously, there is immediate understanding, \nimmediate transformation. If you do not change now, you will never change, \nbecause the change that takes place tomorrow is merely a modification, it is not \ntransformation. Transformation can only take place immediately; the revolution \nis now, not tomorrow. \nWhen that happens, you are completely without a problem, for then the self is \nnot worried about itself; then you are beyond the wave of destruction."

What is it that each one of us wants? \nEspecially in this restless world, where everybody is trying to find some kind of \npeace, some kind of happiness, a refuge, surely it is important to find out, isn’t \nit?, what it is that we are trying to seek, what it is that we are trying to discover. \nProbably most of us are seeking some kind of happiness, some kind of peace; in \na world that is ridden with turmoil, wars, contention, strife, we want a refuge \nwhere there can be some peace. I think that is what most of us want. So we \npursue, go from one leader to another, from one religious organization to another, \nfrom one teacher to another. \nNow, is it that we are seeking happiness or is it that we are seeking \ngratification of some kind from which we hope to derive happiness? There is a \ndifference between happiness and gratification. Can you seek happiness? Perhaps \nyou can find gratification but surely you cannot find happiness. Happiness is \nderivative; it is a by-product of something else. So, before we give our minds and \nhearts to something which demands a great deal of earnestness, attention, \nthought, care, we must find out, must we not?, what it is that we are seeking; \nwhether it is happiness, or gratification. I am afraid most of us are seeking \ngratification. We want to be gratified, we want to find a sense of fullness at the \nend of our search. \nAfter all, if one is seeking peace one can find it very easily. One can devote \noneself blindly to some kind of cause, to an idea, and take shelter there. Surely \nthat does not solve the problem. Mere isolation in an enclosing idea is not a \nrelease from conflict. So we must find, must we not?, what it is, inwardly, as well \nas outwardly, that each one of us wants. If we are clear on that matter, then we \ndon’t have to go anywhere, to any teacher, to any church, to any organization. \nTherefore our difficulty is, to be clear in ourselves regarding our intention, is it \nnot? Can we be clear? And does that clarity come through searching, through \ntrying to find out what others say, from the highest teacher to the ordinary \npreacher in a church round the corner? Have you got to go to somebody to find \nout? Yet that is what we are doing, is it not? We read innumerable books, we \nattend many meetings and discuss, we join various organizations—trying thereby \nto find a remedy to the conflict, to the miseries in our lives. Or, if we don’t do all \nthat, we think we have found; that is we say that a particular organization, a \nparticular teacher, a particular book satisfies us; we have found everything we \nwant in that; and we remain in that, crystallized and enclosed. \nDo we not seek, through all this confusion, something permanent, something \nlasting, something which we call real, God, truth, what you like—the name \ndoesn’t matter, the word is not the thing, surely. So don’t let us be caught in \nwords. Leave that to the professional lecturers. There is a search for something \npermanent, is there not?, in most of us—something we can cling to, something \nwhich will give us assurance, a hope, a lasting enthusiasm, a lasting certainty, \nbecause in ourselves we are so uncertain. We do not know ourselves. We know a"

What is it that we are seeking, which \nwill, or which we hope will give us permanency? Are we not seeking lasting \nhappiness, lasting gratification, lasting certainty? We want something that will \nendure everlastingly, which will gratify us. If we strip ourselves of all the words \nand phrases, and actually look at it, this is what we want. We want permanent \npleasure, permanent gratification—which we call truth, God or what you will. \nVery well, we want pleasure. Perhaps that may be putting it very crudely, but \nthat is actually what we want—knowledge that will give us pleasure, experience \nthat will give us pleasure, a gratification that will not wither away by tomorrow. \nAnd we have experimented with various gratifications, and they have all faded \naway; and we hope now to find permanent gratification in reality, in God. Surely, \nthat is what we are all seeking—the clever ones and the stupid ones, the theorist \nand the factual person who is striving after something. And is there permanent \ngratification? Is there something which will endure? \nNow, if you seek permanent gratification, calling it God, or truth, or what you \nwill—the name does not matter—surely you must understand, must you not?, the \nthing you are seeking. When you say, “I am seeking permanent happiness”—\nGod, or truth, or what you like—must you not also understand the thing that is \nsearching, the searcher, the seeker? Because there may be no such thing as \npermanent security, permanent happiness. Truth may be something entirely \ndifferent; and I think it is utterly different from what you can see, conceive, \nformulate. Therefore, before we seek something permanent, is it not obviously \nnecessary to understand the seeker? Is the seeker different from the thing he \nseeks? When you say, “I am seeking happiness”, is the seeker different from the \nobject of his search? Is the thinker different from the thought? Are they not a \njoint phenomenon, rather than separate processes? Therefore it is essential, is it \nnot?, to understand the seeker, before you try to find out what it is he is seeking. \nSo we have to come to the point when we ask ourselves, really earnestly and \nprofoundly, if peace, happiness, reality, God, or what you will, can be given to us \nby someone else. Can this incessant search, this longing, give us that \nextraordinary sense of reality, that creative being, which comes when we really \nunderstand ourselves? Does self-knowledge come through search, through \nfollowing someone else, through belonging to any particular organization, \nthrough reading books, and so on? After all, that is the main issue, is it not?, that \nso long as I do not understand myself, I have no basis for thought, and all my \nsearch will be in vain. I can escape into illusions, I can run away from \ncontention, strife, struggle; I can worship another; I can look for my salvation \nthrough somebody else. But so long as I am ignorant of myself, so long as I am \nunaware of the total process of myself, I have no basis for thought, for affection, \nfor action. \nBut that is the last thing we want: to know ourselves. Surely that is the only \nfoundation on which we can build. But, before we can build, before we can \ntransform, before we can condemn or destroy, we must know that which we are. \nTo go out seeking, changing teachers, gurus, practicing yoga, breathing,"

It has no meaning, even though the very people whom we follow may say: \n“Study yourself”, because what we are, the world is. If we are petty, jealous, \nvain, greedy—that is what we create about us, that is the society in which we \nlive. \nIt seems to me that before we set out on a journey to find reality, to find God, \nbefore we can act, before we can have any relationship with another, which is \nsociety, it is essential that we begin to understand ourselves first. I consider the \nearnest person to be one who is completely concerned with this, first, and not \nwith how to arrive at a particular goal, because, if you and I do not understand \nourselves, how can we, in action, bring about a transformation in society, in \nrelationship, in anything that we do? And it does not mean, obviously, that self-\nknowledge is opposed to, or isolated from, relationship. It does not mean, \nobviously, emphasis on the individual, the me, as opposed to the mass, as \nopposed to another. \nNow without knowing yourself, without knowing your own way of thinking \nand why you think certain things, without knowing the background of your \nconditioning and why you have certain beliefs about art and religion, about your \ncountry and your neighbour and about yourself, how can you think truly about \nanything? Without knowing your background, without knowing the substance of \nyour thought and whence it comes—surely your search is utterly futile, your \naction has no meaning, has it? Whether you are an American or a Hindu or \nwhatever your religion is has no meaning either. \nBefore we can find out what the end-purpose of life is, what it all means—\nwars, national antagonisms, conflicts, the whole mess—we must begin with \nourselves, must we not? It sounds so simple, but it is extremely difficult. To \nfollow oneself, to see how one’s thought operates, one has to be extraordinarily \nalert, so that as one begins to be more and more alert to the intricacies of one’s \nown thinking and responses and feelings, one begins to have a greater awareness, \nnot only of oneself but of another with whom one is in relationship. To know \noneself is to study oneself in action, which is relationship. The difficulty is that \nwe are so impatient; we want to get on, we want to reach an end, and so we have \nneither the time nor the occasion to give ourselves the opportunity to study, to \nobserve. Alternatively we have committed ourselves to various activities—to \nearning a livelihood, to rearing children—or have taken on certain \nresponsibilities of various organizations; we have so committed ourselves in \ndifferent ways that we have hardly any time for self-reflection, to observe, to \nstudy. So really the responsibility of the reaction depends on oneself, not on \nanother. The pursuit, all the world over, of gurus and their systems, reading the \nlatest books on this and that, and so on, seems to me so utterly empty, so utterly \nfutile, for you may wander all over the earth but you have to come back to \nyourself. And, as most of us are totally unaware of ourselves, it is extremely \ndifficult to begin to see clearly the process of our thinking and feeling and acting. \nThe more you know yourself, the more clarity there is. Self-knowledge has no \nend—you don’t come to an achievement, you don’t come to a conclusion. It is an \nendless river. As one studies it, as one goes into it more and more, one finds"

Are you and I as individuals to be \nused, directed, educated, controlled, shaped to a certain pattern by society and \ngovernment; or does society, the State, exist for the individual? Is the individual \nthe end of society; or is he merely a puppet to be taught, exploited, butchered as \nan instrument of war? That is the problem that is confronting most of us. That is \nthe problem of the world; whether the individual is a mere instrument of society, \na plaything of influences to be moulded; or whether society exists for the \nindividual. \nHow are you going to find this out? It is a serious problem, isn’t it? If the \nindividual is merely an instrument of society, then society is much more \nimportant than the individual. If that is true, then we must give up individuality \nand work for society; our whole educational system must be entirely \nrevolutionized and the individual turned into an instrument to be used and \ndestroyed, liquidated, got rid of. But if society exists for the individual, then the \nfunction of society is not to make him conform to any pattern but to give him the \nfeel, the urge of freedom. So we have to find out which is false. \nHow would you inquire into this problem? It is a vital problem, isn’t it? It is \nnot dependent on any ideology, either of the left or of the right; and if it is \ndependent on an ideology, then it is merely a matter of opinion. Ideas always \nbreed enmity, confusion, conflict. If you depend on books of the left or of the \nright or on sacred books, then you depend on mere opinion, whether of Buddha, \nof Christ, of capitalism, communism or what you will. They are ideas, not truth. \nA fact can never be denied. Opinion about fact can be denied. If we can discover \nwhat the truth of the matter is, we shall be able to act independently of opinion. \nIs it not, therefore, necessary to discard what others have said? The opinion of \nthe leftist or other leaders is the outcome of their conditioning, so if you depend \nfor your discovery on what is found in books, you are merely bound by opinion. \nIt is not a matter of knowledge. \nHow is one to discover the truth of this? On that we will act. To find the truth \nof this, there must be freedom from all propaganda, which means you are capable \nof looking at the problem independently of opinion. The whole task of education \nis to awaken the individual. To see the truth of this, you will have to be very \nclear, which means you cannot depend on a leader. When you choose a leader \nyou do so out of confusion, and so your leaders are also confused, and that is \nwhat is happening in the world. Therefore you cannot look to your leader for \nguidance or help. \nA mind that wishes to understand a problem must not only understand the \nproblem completely, wholly, but must be able to follow it swiftly, because the \nproblem is never static. The problem is always new, whether it is a problem of \nstarvation, a psychological problem, or any problem. Any crisis is always new; \ntherefore, to understand it, a mind must always be fresh, clear, swift in its pursuit. \nI think most of us realize the urgency of an inward revolution, which alone can"

How to \nbring about a fundamental, a radical transformation in society, is our problem; \nand this transformation of the outer cannot take place without inner revolution. \nSince society is always static, any action, any reform which is accomplished \nwithout this inward revolution becomes equally static; so there is no hope \nwithout this constant inward revolution, because, without it, outer action \nbecomes repetitive, habitual. The action of relationship between you and another, \nbetween you and me, is society; and that society becomes static, it has no life-\ngiving quality, so long as there is not this constant inward revolution, a creative, \npsychological transformation; and it is because there is not this constant inward \nrevolution that society is always becoming static, crystallized, and has therefore \nconstantly to be broken up. \nWhat is the relationship between yourself and the misery, the confusion, in \nand around you? Surely this confusion, this misery, did not come into being by \nitself. You and I have created it, not a capitalist nor a communist nor a fascist \nsociety, but you and I have created it in our relationship with each other. What \nyou are within has been projected without, on to the world; what you are, what \nyou think and what you feel, what you do in your everyday existence, is \nprojected outwardly, and that constitutes the world. If we are miserable, \nconfused, chaotic within, by projection that becomes the world, that becomes \nsociety, because the relationship between yourself and myself, between myself \nand another is society—society is the product of our relationship—and if our \nrelationship is confused, egocentric, narrow, limited, national, we project that and \nbring chaos into the world. \nWhat you are, the world is. So your problem is the world’s problem. Surely, \nthis is a simple and basic fact, is it not? In our relationship with the one or the \nmany we seem somehow to overlook this point all the time. We want to bring \nabout alteration through a system or through a revolution in ideas or values based \non a system, forgetting that it is you and I who create society, who bring about \nconfusion or order by the way in which we live. So we must begin near, that is \nwe must concern ourselves with our daily existence, with our daily thoughts and \nfeelings and actions which are revealed in the manner of earning our livelihood \nand in our relationship with ideas or beliefs. This is our daily existence, is it not? \nWe are concerned with livelihood, getting jobs, earning money; we are \nconcerned with the relationship with our family or with our neighbours, and we \nare concerned with ideas and with beliefs. Now, if you examine our occupation, \nit is fundamentally based on envy, it is not just a means of earning a livelihood. \nSociety is so constructed that it is a process of constant conflict, constant \nbecoming; it is based on greed, on envy, envy of your superior; the clerk wanting \nto become the manager, which shows that he is not just concerned with earning a \nlivelihood, a means of subsistence, but with acquiring position and prestige. This \nattitude naturally creates havoc in society, in relationship, but if you and I were \nonly concerned with livelihood we should find out the right means of earning it, a \nmeans not based on envy. Envy is one of the most destructive factors in \nrelationship because envy indicates the desire for power, for position, and it"

The relationship between yourself and \nmyself, between yourself and another—which is society—what is it based on? \nSurely not on love, though we talk about it. It is not based on love, because if \nthere were love there would be order, there would be peace, happiness between \nyou and me. But in that relationship between you and me there is a great deal of \nill will which assumes the form of respect. If we were both equal in thought, in \nfeeling, there would be no respect, there would be no ill will, because we would \nbe two individuals meeting, not as disciple and teacher, nor as the husband \ndominating the wife, nor as the wife dominating the husband. When there is ill \nwill there is a desire to dominate which arouses jealousy, anger, passion, all of \nwhich in our relationship creates constant conflict from which we try to escape, \nand this produces further chaos, further misery. \nNow as regards ideas which are part of our daily existence, beliefs and \nformulations, are they not distorting our minds? For what is stupidity? Stupidity \nis the giving of wrong values to those things which the mind creates, or to those \nthings which the hands produce. Most of our thoughts spring from the self-\nprotective instinct, do they not? Our ideas, oh, so many of them, do they not \nreceive the wrong significance, one which they have not in themselves? \nTherefore when we believe in any form, whether religious, economic or social, \nwhen we believe in God, in ideas, in a social system which separates man from \nman, in nationalism and so on, surely we are giving a wrong significance to \nbelief, which indicates stupidity, for belief divides people, doesn’t unite people. \nSo we see that by the way we live we can produce order or chaos, peace or \nconflict, happiness or misery. \nSo our problem, is it not?, is whether there can be a society which is static, \nand at the same time an individual in whom this constant revolution is taking \nplace. That is, revolution in society must begin with the inner, psychological \ntransformation of the individual. Most of us want to see a radical transformation \nin the social structure. That is the whole battle that is going on in the world—to \nbring about a social revolution through communistic or any other means. Now if \nthere is a social revolution, that is an action with regard to the outer structure of \nman, however radical that social revolution may be its very nature is static if \nthere is no inward revolution of the individual, no psychological transformation. \nTherefore to bring about a society that is not repetitive, nor static, not \ndisintegrating, a society that is constantly alive, it is imperative that there should \nbe a revolution in the psychological structure of the individual, for without \ninward, psychological revolution, mere transformation of the outer has very little \nsignificance. That is society is always becoming crystallized, static, and is \ntherefore always disintegrating. However much and however wisely legislation \nmay be promulgated, society is always in the process of decay because revolution \nmust take place within, not merely outwardly. \nI think it is important to understand this and not slur over it.

Realizing this, realizing the extraordinary significance of this \nfact, there can be no question of agreement or disagreement. It is a fact that \nsociety is always crystallizing and absorbing the individual and that constant, \ncreative revolution can only be in the individual, not in society, not in the outer. \nThat is creative revolution can take place only in individual relationship, which is \nsociety. We see how the structure of the present society in India, in Europe, in \nAmerica, in every part of the world, is rapidly disintegrating; and we know it \nwithin our own lives. We can observe it as we go down the streets. We do not \nneed great historians to tell us the fact that our society is crumbling; and there \nmust be new architects, new builders, to create a new society. The structure must \nbe built on a new foundation, on newly discovered facts and values. Such \narchitects do not yet exist. There are no builders, none who, observing, becoming \naware of the fact that the structure is collapsing, are transforming themselves into \narchitects. That is our problem. We see society crumbling, disintegrating; and it \nis we, you and I, who have to be the architects. You and I have to rediscover the \nvalues and build on a more fundamental, lasting foundation; because if we look \nto the professional architects, the political and religious builders, we shall be \nprecisely in the same position as before. \nBecause you and I are not creative, we have reduced society to this chaos, so \nyou and I have to be creative because the problem is urgent; you and I must be \naware of the causes of the collapse of society and create a new structure based \nnot on mere imitation but on our creative understanding. Now this implies, does \nit not?, negative thinking. Negative thinking is the highest form of understanding. \nThat is in order to understand what is creative thinking, we must approach the \nproblem negatively, because a positive approach to the problem—which is that \nyou and I must become creative in order to build a new structure of society—will \nbe imitative. To understand that which is crumbling, we must investigate it, \nexamine it negatively—not with a positive system, a positive formula, a positive \nconclusion. \nWhy is society crumbling, collapsing, as it surely is? One of the fundamental \nreasons is that the individual, you, has ceased to be creative. I will explain what I \nmean. You and I have become imitative, we are copying, outwardly and \ninwardly. Outwardly, when learning a technique, when communicating with each \nother on the verbal level, naturally there must be some imitation, copy. I copy \nwords. To become an engineer, I must first learn the technique, then use the \ntechnique to build a bridge. There must be a certain amount of imitation, \ncopying, in outward technique, but when there is inward, psychological imitation \nsurely we cease to be creative. Our education, our social structure, our so-called \nreligious life, are all based on imitation; that is I fit into a particular social or \nreligious formula. I have ceased to be a real individual; psychologically, I have \nbecome a mere repetitive machine with certain conditioned responses, whether \nthose of the Hindu, the Christian, the Buddhist, the German or the Englishman. \nOur responses are conditioned according to the pattern of society, whether it is \neastern or western, religious or materialistic. So one of the fundamental causes of"

We can see that \nwhen there is imitation there must be disintegration; when there is authority there \nmust be copying. And since our whole mental, psychological make-up is based \non authority, there must be freedom from authority, to be creative. Have you not \nnoticed that in moments of creativeness, those rather happy moments of vital \ninterest, there is no sense of repetition, no sense of copying? Such moments are \nalways new, fresh, creative, happy. So we see that one of the fundamental causes \nof the disintegration of society is copying, which is the worship of authority."

As I was pointing out, the solution is not \nto be found through conferences, blueprints, or through the substitution of new \nleaders for old, and so on, The solution obviously lies in the creator of the \nproblem, in the creator of the mischief, of the hate and of the enormous \nmisunderstanding that exists between human beings, The creator of this mischief, \nthe creator of these problems, is the individual, you and I, not the world as we \nthink of it. The world is your relationship with another. The world is not \nsomething separate from you and me; the world, society, is the relationship that \nwe establish or seek to establish between each other. \nSo you and I are the problem, and not the world, because the world is the \nprojection of ourselves and to understand the world we must understand \nourselves. That world is not separate from us; we are the world, and our \nproblems are the world’s problems. This cannot be repeated too often, because \nwe are so sluggish in our mentality that we think the world’s problems are not \nour business, that they have to be resolved by the United Nations or by \nsubstituting new leaders for the old. It is a very dull mentality that thinks like \nthat, because we are responsible for this frightful misery and confusion in the \nworld, this ever-impending war. To transform the world, we must begin with \nourselves; and what is important in beginning with ourselves is the intention. The \nintention must be to understand ourselves and not to leave it to others to \ntransform themselves or to bring about a modified change through revolution, \neither of the left or of the right. It is important to understand that this is our \nresponsibility, yours and mine; because, however small may be the world we live \nin, if we can transform ourselves, bring about a radically different point of view \nin our daily existence, then perhaps we shall affect the world at large, the \nextended relationship with others. \nAs I said, we are going to try and find out the process of understanding \nourselves, which is not an isolating process. It is not withdrawal from the world, \nbecause you cannot live in isolation. To be is to be related, and there is no such \nthing as living in isolation. It is the lack of right relationship that brings about \nconflicts, misery and strife; however small our world may be, if we can transform \nour relationship in that narrow world, it will be like a wave extending outward all \nthe time. I think it is important to see that point, that the world is our relationship, \nhowever narrow; and if we can bring a transformation there, not a superficial but \na radical transformation, then we shall begin actively to transform the world. \nReal revolution is not according to any particular pattern, either of the left or of \nthe right, but it is a revolution of values, a revolution from sensate values to the \nvalues that are not sensate or created by environmental influences. To find these \ntrue values which will bring about a radical revolution, a transformation or a \nregeneration, it is essential to understand oneself. Self-knowledge is the"

To understand oneself there must be the intention to understand—\nand that is where our difficulty comes in. Although most of us are discontented, \nwe desire to bring about a sudden change, our discontent is canalized merely to \nachieve a certain result; being discontented, we either seek a different job or \nmerely succumb to environment. Discontent, instead of setting us aflame, \ncausing us to question life, the whole process of existence, is canalized, and \nthereby we become mediocre, losing that drive, that intensity to find out the \nwhole significance of existence. Therefore it is important to discover these things \nfor ourselves, because self-knowledge cannot be given to us by another, it is not \nto be found through any book. We must discover, and to discover there must be \nthe intention, the search, the inquiry. So long as that intention to find out, to \ninquire deeply, is weak or does not exist, mere assertion or a casual wish to find \nout about oneself is of very little significance. \nThus the transformation of the world is brought about by the transformation \nof oneself, because the self is the product and a part of the total process of human \nexistence. To transform oneself, self-knowledge is essential; without knowing \nwhat you are, there is no basis for right thought, and without knowing yourself \nthere cannot be transformation, One must know oneself as one is, not as one \nwishes to be which is merely an ideal and therefore fictitious, unreal; it is only \nthat which is that can be transformed, not that which you wish to be. To know \noneself as one is requires an extraordinary alertness of mind, because what is is \nconstantly undergoing transformation, change, and to follow it swiftly the mind \nmust not be tethered to any particular dogma or belief, to any particular pattern of \naction. If you would follow anything it is no good being tethered. To know \nyourself, there must be the awareness, the alertness of mind in which there is \nfreedom from all beliefs, from all idealization because beliefs and ideals only \ngive you a colour, perverting true perception. If you want to know what you are \nyou cannot imagine or have belief in something which you are not. If I am \ngreedy, envious, violent, merely having an ideal of non-violence, of non-greed, is \nof little value. But to know that one is greedy or violent, to know and understand \nit, requires an extraordinary perception, does it not? It demands honesty, clarity \nof thought, whereas to pursue an ideal away from what is is an escape; it prevents \nyou from discovering and acting directly upon what you are. \nThe understanding of what you are, whatever it be—ugly or beautiful, wicked \nor mischievous—the understanding of what you are, without distortion, is the \nbeginning of virtue. Virtue is essential, for it gives freedom. It is only in virtue \nthat you can discover, that you can live—not in the cultivation of a virtue, which \nmerely brings about respectability, not understanding and freedom. There is a \ndifference between being virtuous and becoming virtuous. Being virtuous comes \nthrough the understanding of what is, whereas becoming virtuous is \npostponement, the covering up of what is with what you would like to be. \nTherefore in becoming virtuous you are avoiding action directly upon what is. \nThis process of avoiding what is through the cultivation of the ideal is considered \nvirtuous; but if you look at it closely and directly you will see that it is nothing of \nthe kind. It is merely a postponement of coming face to face with what is. Virtue"

In order to create a new world, a new structure away from the old, \nthere must be freedom to discover; and to be free, there must be virtue, for \nwithout virtue there is no freedom. Can the immoral man who is striving to \nbecome virtuous ever know virtue? The man who is not moral can never be free, \nand therefore he can never find out what reality is. Reality can be found only in \nunderstanding what is; and to understand what is, there must be freedom, \nfreedom from the fear of what is. \nTo understand that process there must be the intention to know what is, to \nfollow every thought, feeling and action; and to understand what is is extremely \ndifficult, because what is is never still, never static, it is always in movement. \nThe what is is what you are, not what you would like to be; it is not the ideal, \nbecause the ideal is fictitious, but it is actually what you are doing, thinking and \nfeeling from moment to moment. What is is the actual, and to understand the \nactual requires awareness, a very alert, swift mind. But if we begin to condemn \nwhat is, if we begin to blame or resist it, then we shall not understand its \nmovement. If I want to understand somebody, I cannot condemn him: I must \nobserve, study him. I must love the very thing I am studying. If you want to \nunderstand a child, you must love and not condemn him. You must play with \nhim, watch his movements, his idiosyncrasies, his ways of behaviour; but if you \nmerely condemn, resist or blame him, there is no comprehension of the child. \nSimilarly, to understand what is, one must observe what one thinks, feels and \ndoes from moment to moment. That is the actual. Any other action, any ideal or \nideological action, is not the actual; it is merely a wish, a fictitious desire to be \nsomething other than what is. \nTo understand what is requires a state of mind in which there is no \nidentification or condemnation, which means a mind that is alert and yet passive. \nWe are in that state when we really desire to understand something; when the \nintensity of interest is there, that state of mind comes into being. When one is \ninterested in understanding what is, the actual state of the mind, one does not \nneed to force, discipline, or control it; on the contrary, there is passive alertness, \nwatchfulness. This state of awareness comes when there is interest, the intention \nto understand. \nThe fundamental understanding of oneself does not come through knowledge \nor through the accumulation of experiences, which is merely the cultivation of \nmemory. The understanding of oneself is from moment to moment; if we merely \naccumulate knowledge of the self, that very knowledge prevents further \nunderstanding, because accumulated knowledge and experience becomes the \ncentre through which thought focuses and has its being. The world is not \ndifferent from us and our activities because it is what we are which creates the \nproblems of the world; the difficulty with the majority of us is that we do not \nknow ourselves directly, but seek a system, a method, a means of operation by \nwhich to solve the many human problems. \nNow is there a means, a system, of knowing oneself?

That is by following a method, a system, a means through which to know \nmyself, I shape my thinking, my activities, according to a pattern; but the \nfollowing of a pattern is not the understanding of oneself. \nTherefore there is no method for self-knowledge. Seeking a method \ninvariably implies the desire to attain some result—and that is what we all want. \nWe follow authority—if not that of a person, then of a system, of an ideology—\nbecause we want a result which will be satisfactory, which will give us security. \nWe really do not want to understand ourselves, our impulses and reactions, the \nwhole process of our thinking, the conscious as well as the unconscious; we \nwould rather pursue a system which assures us of a result. But the pursuit of a \nsystem is invariably the outcome of our desire for security, for certainty, and the \nresult is obviously not the understanding of oneself. When we follow a method, \nwe must have authorities—the teacher, the guru, the saviour, the Master—who \nwill guarantee us what we desire; and surely that is not the way to self-\nknowledge. \nAuthority prevents the understanding of oneself, does it not? Under the \nshelter of an authority, a guide, you may have temporarily a sense of security, a \nsense of well-being, but that is not the understanding of the total process of \noneself. Authority in its very nature prevents the full awareness of oneself and \ntherefore ultimately destroys freedom; in freedom alone can there be \ncreativeness. There can be creativeness only through self-knowledge. Most of us \nare not creative; we are repetitive machines, mere gramophone records playing \nover and over again certain songs of experience, certain conclusions and \nmemories, either our own or those of another. Such repetition is not creative \nbeing—but it is what we want. Because we want to be inwardly secure, we are \nconstantly seeking methods and means for this security, and thereby we create \nauthority, the worship of another, which destroys comprehension, that \nspontaneous tranquillity of mind in which alone there can be a state of \ncreativeness. \nSurely our difficulty is that most of us have lost this sense of creativeness. To \nbe creative does not mean that we must paint pictures or write poems and \nbecome famous. That is not creativeness—it is merely the capacity to express an \nidea, which the public applauds or disregards. Capacity and creativeness should \nnot be confused. Capacity is not creativeness. Creativeness is quite a different \nstate of being, is it not? It is a state in which the self is absent, in which the mind \nis no longer a focus of our experiences, our ambitions, our pursuits and our \ndesires. Creativeness is not a continuous state, it is new from moment to moment, \nit is a movement in which there is not the ‘me’, the ‘mine’, in which the thought \nis not focused on any particular experience, ambition, achievement, purpose and \nmotive. It is only when the self is not that there is creativeness—that state of \nbeing in which alone there can be reality, the creator of all things.

But we find it difficult to be alert, to \nbe aware, and we prefer to dull our minds by following a method, by accepting \nauthorities, superstitions and gratifying theories; so our minds become weary, \nexhausted and insensitive. Such a mind cannot be in a state of creativeness.

    "text": "C H A P T E R  V \n \nA C T I O N  A N D  I D E A \n \nI should like to discuss the problem of action. This may be rather abstruse and \ndifficult at the beginning but I hope that by thinking it over we shall be able to \nsee the issue clearly, because our whole existence, our whole life, is a process of \naction. \nMost of us live in a series of actions, of seemingly unrelated, disjointed \nactions, leading to disintegration, to frustration. It is a problem that concerns each \none of us, because we live by action and without action there is no life, there is \nno experience, there is no thinking. Thought is action; and merely to pursue \naction at one particular level of consciousness, which is the outer, merely to be \ncaught up in outward action without understanding the whole process of action \nitself, will inevitably lead us to frustration, to misery. \nOur life is a series of actions or a process of action at different levels of \nconsciousness. Consciousness is experiencing, naming and recording. That is \nconsciousness is challenge and response, which is experiencing, then terming or \nnaming, and then recording, which is memory. This process is action, is it not? \nConsciousness is action; and without challenge, response, without experiencing, \nnaming or terming, without recording, which is memory, there is no action. \nNow action creates the actor. That is the actor comes into being when action \nhas a result, an end in view. If there is no result in action, then there is no actor; \nbut if there is an end or a result in view, then action brings about the actor. Thus \nactor, action, and end or result, is a unitary process, a single process, which \ncomes into being when action has an end in view. Action towards a result is will; \notherwise there is no will, is there? The desire to achieve an end brings about \nwill, which is the actor—I want to achieve, I want to write a book, I want to be a \nrich man, I want to paint a picture. \nWe are familiar with these three states: the actor, the action, and the end. That \nis our daily existence. I am just explaining what is; but we will begin to \nunderstand how to transform what is only when we examine it clearly, so that \nthere is no illusion or prejudice, no bias with regard to it. Now these three states \nwhich constitute experience—the actor, the action, and the result—are surely a \nprocess of becoming. Otherwise there is no becoming, is there? If there is no \nactor, and if there is no action towards an end, there is no becoming; but life as \nwe know it, our daily life, is a process of becoming. I am poor and I act with an \nend in view, which is to become rich. I am ugly and I want to become beautiful. \nTherefore my life is a process of becoming something. The will to be is the will \nto become, at different levels of consciousness, in different states, in which there \nis challenge, response, naming and recording. Now this becoming is strife, this \nbecoming is pain, is it not? It is a constant struggle: I am this, and I want to \nbecome that. \nTherefore, then, the problem is: Is there not action without this becoming? Is \nthere not action without this pain, without this constant battle? If there is no end, \nthere is no actor, because action with an end in view creates the actor. But can \nthere be action without an end in view, and therefore no actor—that is without"

    "text": "the desire for a result? Such action is not a becoming, and therefore not a strife. \nThere is a state of action, a state of experiencing, without the experiencer and the \nexperience. This sounds rather philosophical but it is really quite simple. \nIn the moment of experiencing, you are not aware of yourself as the \nexperiencer apart from the experience; you are in a state of experiencing. Take a \nvery simple example: you are angry. In that moment of anger there is neither the \nexperiencer nor the experience; there is only experiencing. But the moment you \ncome out of it, a split second after the experiencing, there is the experiencer and \nthe experience, the actor and the action with an end in view—which is to get rid \nof or to suppress the anger. We are in this state repeatedly, in the state of \nexperiencing; but we always come out of it and give it a term, naming and \nrecording it, and thereby giving continuity to becoming. \nIf we can understand action in the fundamental sense of the word then that \nfundamental understanding will affect our superficial activities also; but first we \nmust understand the fundamental nature of action. Now is action brought about \nby an idea? Do you have an idea first and act afterwards? Or does action come \nfirst and then, because action creates conflict, you build around it an idea? Does \naction create the actor or does the actor come first? \nIt is very important to discover which comes first. If the idea comes first, then \naction merely conforms to an idea, and therefore it is no longer action but \nimitation, compulsion according to an idea. It is very important to realize this; \nbecause, as our society is mostly constructed on the intellectual or verbal level, \nthe idea comes first with all of us and action follows. Action is then the \nhandmaid of an idea, and the mere construction of ideas is obviously detrimental \nto action. Ideas breed further ideas, and when there is merely the breeding of \nideas there is antagonism, and society becomes top-heavy with the intellectual \nprocess of ideation. Our social structure is very intellectual; we are cultivating \nthe intellect at the expense of every other factor of our being and therefore we are \nsuffocated with ideas. \nCan ideas ever produce action, or do ideas merely mould thought and \ntherefore limit action? When action is compelled by an idea, action can never \nliberate man. It is extraordinarily important for us to understand this point. If an \nidea shapes action, then action can never bring about the solution to our miseries \nbecause, before it can be put into action, we have first to discover how the idea \ncomes into being. The investigation of ideation, of the building up of ideas, \nwhether of the socialists, the capitalists, the communists, or of the various \nreligions, is of the utmost importance, especially when our society is at the edge \nof a precipice, inviting another catastrophe, another excision. Those who are \nreally serious in their intention to discover the human solution to our many \nproblems must first understand this process of ideation. \nWhat do we mean by an idea? How does an idea come into being? And can \nidea and action be brought together? Suppose I have an idea and I wish to carry it \nout. I seek a method of carrying out that idea, and we speculate, waste our time \nand energies in quarrelling over how the idea should be carried out. So, it is \nreally very important to find out how ideas come into being; and after"

    "text": "discovering the truth of that we can discuss the question of action. Without \ndiscussing ideas, merely to find out how to act has no meaning. \nNow how do you get an idea—a very simple idea, it need not be \nphilosophical, religious or economic? Obviously it is a process of thought, is it \nnot? Idea is the outcome of a thought process. Without a thought process, there \ncan be no idea. So I have to understand the thought process itself before I can \nunderstand its product, the idea. What do we mean by thought? When do you \nthink? Obviously thought is the result of a response, neurological or \npsychological, is it not? It is the immediate response of the senses to a sensation, \nor it is psychological, the response of stored-up memory. There is the immediate \nresponse of the nerves to a sensation, and there is the psychological response of \nstored-up memory, the influence of race, group, guru, family, tradition, and so \non—all of which you call thought. So the thought process is the response of \nmemory, is it not? You would have no thoughts if you had no memory; and the \nresponse of memory to a certain experience brings the thought process into \naction. Say, for example, I have the stored-up memories of nationalism, calling \nmyself a Hindu. That reservoir of memories of past responses, actions, \nimplications, traditions, customs, responds to the challenge of a Mussulman, a \nBuddhist or a Christian, and the response of memory to the challenge inevitably \nbrings about a thought process. Watch the thought process operating in yourself \nand you can test the truth of this directly. You have been insulted by someone, \nand that remains in your memory; it forms part of the background. When you \nmeet the person, which is the challenge, the response is the memory of that \ninsult. So the response of memory, which is the thought process, creates an idea; \ntherefore the idea is always conditioned—and this is important to understand. \nThat is to say the idea is the result of the thought process, the thought process is \nthe response of memory, and memory is always conditioned. Memory is always \nin the past, and that memory is given life in the present by a challenge. Memory \nhas no life in itself; it comes to life in the present when confronted by a \nchallenge. And all memory, whether dormant or active, is conditioned, is it not? \nTherefore there has to be quite a different approach. You have to find out for \nyourself, inwardly, whether you are acting on an idea, and if there can be action \nwithout ideation. Let us find out what that is: action which is not based on an \nidea. \nWhen do you act without ideation? When is there an action which is not the \nresult of experience? An action based on experience is, as we said, limiting, and \ntherefore a hindrance. Action which is not the outcome of an idea is spontaneous \nwhen the thought process, which is based on experience, is not controlling \naction; which means that there is action independent of experience when the \nmind is not controlling action. That is the only state in which there is \nunderstanding: when the mind, based on experience, is not guiding action: when \nthought, based on experience, is not shaping action. What is action, when there is \nno thought process? Can there be action without thought process? That is I want \nto build a bridge, a house. I know the technique, and the technique tells me how \nto build it. We call that action. There is the action of writing a poem, of painting, \nof governmental responsibilities, of social, environmental responses. All are"

Love is not the \nthinking about the person that one loves, for then it is merely thought. You \ncannot think of love. You can think of the person you love or are devoted to—\nyour guru, your image, your wife, your husband; but the thought, the symbol, is \nnot the real which is love. Therefore love is not an experience. \nWhen there is love there is action, is there not?, and is that action not \nliberating? It is not the result of mentation, and there is no gap between love and \naction, as there is between idea and action. Idea is always old, casting its shadow \non the present and we are ever trying to build a bridge between action and idea. \nWhen there is love—which is not mentation, which is not ideation, which is not \nmemory, which is not the outcome of an experience, of a practised discipline—\nthen that very love is action. That is the only thing that frees. So long as there is \nmentation, so long as there is the shaping of action by an idea which is \nexperience, there can be no release; and so long as that process continues, all \naction is limited. When the truth of this is seen, the quality of love, which is not \nmentation, which you cannot think about, comes into being. \nOne has to be aware of this total process, of how ideas come into being, how \naction springs from ideas, and how ideas control action and therefore limit \naction, depending on sensation. It doesn’t matter whose ideas they are, whether \nfrom the left or from the extreme right. So long as we cling to ideas, we are in a \nstate in which there can be no experiencing at all. Then we are merely living in \nthe field of time—in the past, which gives further sensation, or in the future, \nwhich is another form of sensation. It is only when the mind is free from idea that \nthere can be experiencing. \nIdeas are not truth; and truth is something that must be experienced directly, \nfrom moment to moment. It is not an experience which you want—which is then \nmerely sensation. Only when one can go beyond the bundle of ideas—which is \nthe ‘me’, which is the mind, which has a partial or complete continuity—only \nwhen one can go beyond that, when thought is completely silent, is there a state \nof experiencing.

This, after all, is the truth: to \nhave the capacity of meeting everything anew, from moment to moment, without \nthe conditioning reaction of the past, so that there is not the cumulative effect \nwhich acts as a barrier between oneself and that which is. \nIf you consider, you will see that one of the reasons for the desire to accept a \nbelief is fear. If we had no belief, what would happen to us? Shouldn’t we be \nvery frightened of what might happen? If we had no pattern of action, based on a \nbelief—either in God, or in communism, or in socialism, or in imperialism, or in \nsome kind of religious formula, some dogma in which we are conditioned—we \nshould feel utterly lost, shouldn’t we? And is not this acceptance of a belief the \ncovering up of that fear—the fear of being really nothing, of being empty? After \nall, a cup is useful only when it is empty; and a mind that is filled with beliefs, \nwith dogmas, with assertions, with quotations, is really an uncreative mind; it is \nmerely a repetitive mind. To escape from that fear—that fear of emptiness, that \nfear of loneliness, that fear of stagnation, of not arriving, not succeeding, not \nachieving, not being something, not becoming something—is surely one of the \nreasons, is it not?, why we accept beliefs so eagerly and greedily. And, through \nacceptance of belief, do we understand ourselves? On the contrary. A belief, \nreligious or political, obviously hinders the understanding of ourselves. It acts as \na screen through which we are looking at ourselves. And can we look at \nourselves without beliefs? If we remove those beliefs, the many beliefs that one \nhas, is there anything left to look at? If we have no beliefs with which the mind \nhas identified itself, then the mind, without identification, is capable of looking at \nitself as it is—and then, surely, there is the beginning of the understanding of \noneself."

    "text": "It is really a very interesting problem, this question of belief and knowledge. \nWhat an extraordinary part it plays in our life! How many beliefs we have! \nSurely the more intellectual, the more cultured, the more spiritual, if I can use \nthat word, a person is, the less is his capacity to understand. The savages have \ninnumerable superstitions, even in the modern world. The more thoughtful, the \nmore awake, the more alert are perhaps the less believing. That is because belief \nbinds, belief isolates; and we see that is so throughout the world, the economic \nand the political world, and also in the so-called spiritual world. You believe \nthere is God, and perhaps I believe that there is no God; or you believe in the \ncomplete state control of everything and of every individual, and I believe in \nprivate enterprise and all the rest of it; you believe that there is only one Saviour \nand through him you can achieve your goal, and I don’t believe so. Thus you \nwith your belief and I with mine are asserting ourselves. Yet we both talk of love, \nof peace, of unity of mankind, of one life—which means absolutely nothing; \nbecause actually the very belief is a process of isolation. You are a Brahmin, I a \nnon-Brahmin; you are a Christian, I a Mussulman, and so on. You talk of \nbrotherhood and I also talk of the same brotherhood, love and peace; but in \nactuality we are separated, we are dividing ourselves. A man who wants peace \nand who wants to create a new world, a happy world, surely cannot isolate \nhimself through any form of belief. Is that clear? It may be verbally, but, if you \nsee the significance and validity and the truth of it, it will begin to act. \nWe see that where there is a process of desire at work there must be the \nprocess of isolation through belief, because obviously you believe in order to be \nsecure economically, spiritually, and also inwardly. I am not talking of those \npeople who believe for economic reasons, because they are brought up to depend \non their jobs and therefore will be Catholics, Hindus—it does not matter what—\nas long as there is a job for them. We are also not discussing those people who \ncling to a belief for the sake of convenience. Perhaps with most of us it is equally \nso. For convenience, we believe in certain things. Brushing aside these economic \nreasons, we must go more deeply into it. Take the people who believe strongly in \nanything, economic, social or spiritual; the process behind it is the psychological \ndesire to be secure, is it not? And then there is the desire to continue. We are not \ndiscussing here whether there is or there is not continuity; we are only discussing \nthe urge, the constant impulse to believe. A man of peace, a man who would \nreally understand the whole process of human existence, cannot be bound by a \nbelief, can he? He sees his desire at work as a means to being secure. Please do \nnot go to the other side and say that I am preaching non-religion. That is not my \npoint at all. My point is that as long as we do not understand the process of desire \nin the form of belief, there must be contention, there must be conflict, there must \nbe sorrow, and man will be against man—which is seen every day. So if I \nperceive, if I am aware, that this process takes the form of belief, which is an \nexpression of the craving for inward security, then my problem is not that I \nshould believe this or that but that I should free myself from the desire to be \nsecure. Can the mind be free from the desire for security? That is the problem—\nnot what to believe and how much to believe. These are merely expressions of"

We want to be secure and therefore need the aid of our estates, our \nproperty and our family. We want to be secure inwardly and also spiritually by \nerecting walls of belief, which are an indication of this craving to be certain. Can \nyou as an individual be free from this urge, this craving to be secure, which \nexpresses itself in the desire to believe in something? If we are not free of all \nthat, we are a source of contention; we are not peacemaking; we have no love in \nour hearts. Belief destroys; and this is seen in our everyday life. Can I see myself \nwhen I am caught in this process of desire, which expresses itself in clinging to a \nbelief? Can the mind free itself from belief—not find a substitute for it but be \nentirely free from it? You cannot verbally answer “yes” or “no” to this; but you \ncan definitely give an answer if your intention is to become free from belief. You \nthen inevitably come to the point at which you are seeking the means to free \nyourself from the urge to be secure. Obviously there is no security inwardly \nwhich, as you like to believe, will continue. You like to believe there is a God \nwho is carefully looking after your petty little things, telling you whom you \nshould see, what you should do and how you should do it. This is childish and \nimmature thinking. You think the Great Father is watching every one of us. That \nis a mere projection of your own personal liking. It is obviously not true. Truth \nmust be something entirely different. \nOur next problem is that of knowledge. Is knowledge necessary to the \nunderstanding of truth? When I say “I know”, the implication is that there is \nknowledge. Can such a mind be capable of investigating and searching out what \nis reality? And besides, what is it we know, of which we are so proud? Actually \nwhat is it we know? We know information; we are full of information and \nexperience based on our conditioning, our memory and our capacities. When you \nsay “I know”, what do you mean? Either the acknowledgement that you know is \nthe recognition of a fact, of certain information, or it is an experience that you \nhave had. The constant accumulation of information, the acquisition of various \nforms of knowledge, all constitutes the assertion “I know”; and you start \ntranslating what you have read, according to your background, your desire, your \nexperience. Your knowledge is a thing in which a process similar to the process \nof desire is at work. Instead of belief we substitute knowledge. “I know, I have \nhad experience, it cannot be refuted; my experience is that, on that I completely \nrely”; these are indications of that knowledge. But when you go behind it, \nanalyse it, look at it more intelligently and carefully, you will find that the very \nassertion “I know” is another wall separating you and me. Behind that wall you \ntake refuge, seeking comfort, security. Therefore the more knowledge a mind is \nburdened with, the less capable it is of understanding. \nI do not know if you have ever thought of this problem of acquiring \nknowledge—whether knowledge does ultimately help us to love, to be free from \nthose qualities which produce conflict in ourselves and with our neighbours; \nwhether knowledge ever frees the mind of ambition. Because ambition is, after \nall, one of the qualities that destroy relationship, that put man against man. If we"

Is it ever possible \nfor the mind to be free from this accumulating process of knowledge, this desire \nto know? \nIt is a very interesting thing to watch how in our life these two, knowledge \nand belief, play an extraordinarily powerful part. Look how we worship those \nwho have immense knowledge and erudition! Can you understand the meaning \nof it? If you would find something new, experience something which is not a \nprojection of your imagination, your mind must be free, must it not? It must be \ncapable of seeing something new. Unfortunately, every time you see something \nnew you bring in all the information known to you already, all your knowledge, \nall your past memories; and obviously you become incapable of looking, \nincapable of receiving anything that is new, that is not of the old. Please don’t \nimmediately translate this into detail. If I do not know how to get back to my \nhouse, I shall be lost; if I do not know how to run a machine, I shall be of little \nuse. That is quite a different thing. We are not discussing that here. We are \ndiscussing knowledge that is used as a means to security, the psychological and \ninward desire to be something. What do you get through knowledge? The \nauthority of knowledge, the weight of knowledge, the sense of importance, \ndignity, the sense of vitality and whatnot? A man who says “I know”, “There is” \nor “There is not” surely has stopped thinking, stopped pursuing this whole \nprocess of desire. \nOur problem then, as I see it, is that we are bound, weighed down by belief, \nby knowledge; and is it possible for a mind to be free from yesterday and from \nthe beliefs that have been acquired through the process of yesterday? Do you \nunderstand the question? Is it possible for me as an individual and you as an \nindividual to live in this society and yet be free from the beliefs in which we have \nbeen brought up? Is it possible for the mind to be free of all that knowledge, all \nthat authority? We read the various scriptures, religious books. There they have \nvery carefully described what to do, what not to do, how to attain the goal, what \nthe goal is and what God is. You all know that by heart and you have pursued \nthat. That is your knowledge, that is what you have acquired, that is what you \nhave learnt; along that path you pursue. Obviously what you pursue and seek, \nyou will find. But is it reality? Is it not the projection of your own knowledge? It \nis not reality. Is it possible to realize that now—not tomorrow, but now—and say \n“I see the truth of it”, and let it go, so that your mind is not crippled by this \nprocess of imagination, of projection? \nIs the mind capable of freedom from belief? You can only be free from it \nwhen you understand the inward nature of the causes that make you hold on to it, \nnot only the conscious but the unconscious motives as well, that make you \nbelieve. After all, we are not merely a superficial entity functioning on the \nconscious level. We can find out the deeper conscious and unconscious activities \nif we give the unconscious mind a chance, because it is much quicker in response \nthan the conscious mind.

Can it look anew and remove the process of isolation between you \nand another? Please do not say that belief brings people together. It does not. \nThat is obvious. No organized religion has ever done that. Look at yourselves in \nyour own country. You are all believers, but are you all together? Are you all \nunited? You yourselves know you are not. You are divided into so many petty \nlittle parties, castes; you know the innumerable divisions. The process is the \nsame right through the world—whether in the east or in the west—Christians \ndestroying Christians, murdering each other for petty little things, driving people \ninto camps and so on, the whole horror of war. Therefore belief does not unite \npeople. That is so clear. If that is clear and that is true, and if you see it, then it \nmust be followed. But the difficulty is that most of us do not see, because we are \nnot capable of facing that inward insecurity, that inward sense of being alone. We \nwant something to lean on, whether it is the State, whether it is the caste, whether \nit is nationalism, whether it is a Master or a Saviour or anything else. And when \nwe see the falseness of all this, the mind then is capable—it may be temporarily \nfor a second—of seeing the truth of it; even though when it is too much for it, it \ngoes back. But to see temporarily is sufficient; if you can see it for a fleeting \nsecond, it is enough; because you will then see an extraordinary thing taking \nplace. The unconscious is at work, though the conscious may reject. It is not a \nprogressive second; but that second is the only thing, and it will have its own \nresults, even in spite of the conscious mind struggling against it. \nSo our question is: “Is it possible for the mind to be free from knowledge and \nbelief?” Is not the mind made up of knowledge and belief? Is not the structure of \nthe mind belief and knowledge? Belief and knowledge are the processes of \nrecognition, the centre of the mind. The process is enclosing, the process is \nconscious as well as unconscious. Can the mind be free of its own structure? Can \nthe mind cease to be? That is the problem. Mind, as we know it, has belief behind \nit, has desire, the urge to be secure, knowledge, and accumulation of strength. If, \nwith all its power and superiority, one cannot think for oneself, there can be no \npeace in the world. You may talk about peace, you may organize political parties, \nyou may shout from the housetops; but you cannot have peace; because in the \nmind is the very basis which creates contradiction, which isolates and separates. \nA man of peace, a man of earnestness, cannot isolate himself and yet talk of \nbrotherhood and peace. It is just a game, political or religious, a sense of \nachievement and ambition. A man who is really earnest about this, who wants to \ndiscover, has to face the problem of knowledge and belief; he has to go behind it, \nto discover the whole process of desire at work, the desire to be secure, the desire \nto be certain. \nA mind that would be in a state in which the new can take place—whether it \nbe the truth, whether it be God, or what you will—must surely cease to acquire, \nto gather; it must put aside all knowledge. A mind burdened with knowledge \ncannot possibly understand, surely, that which is real, which is not measurable."

We \ncannot conceive of an action without volition, without effort; our life is based on \nit. Our social, economic and so-called spiritual life is a series of efforts, always \nculminating in a certain result. And we think effort is essential, necessary. \nWhy do we make effort? Is it not, put simply, in order to achieve a result, to \nbecome something, to reach a goal? If we do not make an effort, we think we \nshall stagnate. We have an idea about the goal towards which we are constantly \nstriving; and this striving has become part of our life. If we want to alter \nourselves, if we want to bring about a radical change in ourselves, we make a \ntremendous effort to eliminate the old habits, to resist the habitual environmental \ninfluences and so on. So we are used to this series of efforts in order to find or \nachieve something, in order to live at all. \nIs not all such effort the activity of the self? Is not effort self-centred activity? \nIf we make an effort from the centre of the self, it must inevitably produce more \nconflict, more confusion, more misery. Yet we keep on making effort after effort. \nVery few of us realize that the self-centred activity of effort does not clear up any \nof our problems. On the contrary, it increases our confusion and our misery and \nour sorrow. We know this; and yet we continue hoping somehow to break \nthrough this self-centred activity of effort, the action of the will. \nI think we shall understand the significance of life, if we understand what it \nmeans to make an effort. Does happiness come through effort? Have you ever \ntried to be happy? It is impossible, is it not? You struggle to be happy and there \nis no happiness, is there? Joy does not come through suppression, through control \nor indulgence. You may indulge but there is bitterness at the end. You may \nsuppress or control, but there is always strife in the hidden. Therefore happiness \ndoes not come through effort, nor joy through control and suppression; and still \nall our life is a series of suppressions, a series of controls, a series of regretful \nindulgences. Also there is a constant overcoming, a constant struggle with our \npassions, our greed and our stupidity. So do we not strive, struggle, make effort, \nin the hope of finding happiness, finding something which will give us a feeling \nof peace, a sense of love? Yet does love or understanding come by strife? I think \nit is very important to understand what we mean by struggle, strife or effort. \nDoes not effort mean a struggle to change what is into what is not, or into \nwhat it should be or should become? That is we are constantly struggling to \navoid facing what is, or we are trying to get away from it or to transform or \nmodify what is. A man who is truly content is the man who understands what is, \ngives the right significance to what is. That is true contentment; it is not \nconcerned with having few or many possessions but with the understanding of \nthe whole significance of what is; and that can only come when you recognize \nwhat is, when you are aware of it, not when you are trying to modify it or change \nit. \nSo we see that effort is a strife or a struggle to transform that which is into \nsomething which you wish it to be.

I am only talking of that \nstruggle which is psychological and which always overcomes the technical. You \nmay build with great care a marvellous society, using the infinite knowledge \nscience has given us. But so long as the psychological strife and struggle and \nbattle are not understood and the psychological overtones and currents are not \novercome, the structure of society, however marvellously built, is bound to crash, \nas has happened over and over again. \nEffort is a distraction from what is. The moment I accept what is there is no \nstruggle. Any form of struggle or strife is an indication of distraction; and \ndistraction, which is effort, must exist so long as psychologically I wish to \ntransform what is into something it is not. \nFirst we must be free to see that joy and happiness do not come through \neffort. Is creation through effort, or is there creation only with the cessation of \neffort? When do you write, paint or sing? When do you create? Surely when \nthere is no effort, when you are completely open, when on all levels you are in \ncomplete communication, completely integrated. Then there is joy and then you \nbegin to sing or write a poem or paint or fashion something. The moment of \ncreation is not born of struggle. \nPerhaps in understanding the question of creativeness we shall be able to \nunderstand what we mean by effort. Is creativeness the outcome of effort, and are \nwe aware in those moments when we are creative? Or is creativeness a sense of \ntotal self-forgetfulness, that sense when there is no turmoil, when one is wholly \nunaware of the movement of thought, when there is only a complete, full, rich \nbeing? Is that state the result of travail, of struggle, of conflict, of effort? I do not \nknow if you have ever noticed that when you do something easily, swiftly, there \nis no effort, there is complete absence of struggle; but as our lives are mostly a \nseries of battles, conflicts and struggles, we cannot imagine a life, a state of \nbeing, in which strife has fully ceased. \nTo understand the state of being without strife, that state of creative existence, \nsurely one must inquire into the whole problem of effort. We mean by effort the \nstriving to fulfil oneself, to become something, don’t we? I am this, and I want to \nbecome that; I am not that, and I must become that. In becoming ‘that’, there is \nstrife, there is battle, conflict, struggle. In this struggle we are concerned \ninevitably with fulfilment through the gaining of an end; we seek self-fulfilment \nin an object, in a person, in an idea, and that demands constant battle, struggle, \nthe effort to become, to fulfil. So we have taken this effort as inevitable; and I \nwonder if it is inevitable—this struggle to become something? Why is there this \nstruggle? Where there is the desire for fulfilment, in whatever degree and at \nwhatever level, there must be struggle. Fulfilment is the motive, the drive behind \nthe effort; whether it is in the big executive, the housewife, or a poor man, there \nis this battle to become, to fulfil, going on. \nNow why is there the desire to fulfil oneself? Obviously, the desire to fulfil, \nto become something, arises when there is awareness of being nothing. Because I \nam nothing, because I am insufficient, empty, inwardly poor, I struggle to \nbecome something; outwardly or inwardly I struggle to fulfil myself in a person,"

To fill that void is the whole process of our existence. \nBeing aware that we are empty, inwardly poor, we struggle either to collect \nthings outwardly, or to cultivate inward riches. There is effort only when there is \nan escape from that inward void through action, through contemplation, through \nacquisition, through achievement, through power, and so on. That is our daily \nexistence. I am aware of my insufficiency, my inward poverty, and I struggle to \nrun away from it or to fill it. This running away, avoiding, or trying to cover up \nthe void, entails struggle, strife, effort. \nNow if one does not make an effort to run away, what happens? One lives \nwith that loneliness, that emptiness; and in accepting that emptiness one will find \nthat there comes a creative state which has nothing to do with strife, with effort. \nEffort exists only so long as we are trying to avoid that inward loneliness, \nemptiness, but when we look at it, observe it, when we accept what is without \navoidance, we will find there comes a state of being in which all strife ceases. \nThat state of being is creativeness and it is not the result of strife. \nBut when there is understanding of what is, which is emptiness, inward \ninsufficiency, when one lives with that insufficiency and understands it fully, \nthere comes creative reality, creative intelligence, which alone brings happiness. \nTherefore action as we know it is really reaction, it is a ceaseless becoming, \nwhich is the denial, the avoidance of what is; but when there is awareness of \nemptiness without choice, without condemnation or justification, then in that \nunderstanding of what is there is action, and this action is creative being. You \nwill understand this if you are aware of yourself in action. Observe yourself as \nyou are acting, not only outwardly but see also the movement of your thought \nand feeling. When you are aware of this movement you will see that the thought \nprocess, which is also feeling and action, is based on an idea of becoming. The \nidea of becoming arises only when there is a sense of insecurity, and that sense of \ninsecurity comes when one is aware of the inward void. If you are aware of that \nprocess of thought and feeling, you will see that there is a constant battle going \non, an effort to change, to modify, to alter what is. This is the effort to become, \nand becoming is a direct avoidance of what is. Through self-knowledge, through \nconstant awareness, you will find that strife, battle, the conflict of becoming, \nleads to pain, to sorrow and ignorance. It is only if you are aware of inward \ninsufficiency and live with it without escape, accepting it wholly, that you will \ndiscover an extraordinary tranquillity, a tranquillity which is not put together, \nmade up, but a tranquillity which comes with understanding of what is.

There is in us a constant state of \ndenial and assertion—what we want to be and what we are. The state of \ncontradiction creates conflict and this conflict does not bring about peace—\nwhich is a simple, obvious fact. This inward contradiction should not be \ntranslated into some kind of philosophical dualism, because that is a very easy \nescape. That is by saying that contradiction is a state of dualism we think we \nhave solved it—which is obviously a mere convention, a contributory escape \nfrom actuality. \nNow what do we mean by conflict, by contradiction? Why is there a \ncontradiction in me?—this constant struggle to be something apart from what I \nam. I am this, and I want to be that. This contradiction in us is a fact, not a \nmetaphysical dualism. Metaphysics has no significance in understanding what is. \nWe may discuss, say, dualism, what it is, if it exists, and so on; but of what value \nis it if we don’t know that there is contradiction in us, opposing desires, opposing \ninterests, opposing pursuits? I want to be good and I am not able to be. This \ncontradiction, this opposition in us, must be understood because it creates \nconflict; and in conflict, in struggle, we cannot create individually. Let us be \nclear on the state we are in. There is contradiction, so there must be struggle; and \nstruggle is destruction, waste. In that state we can produce nothing but \nantagonism, strife, more bitterness and sorrow. If we can understand this fully \nand hence be free of contradiction, then there can be inward peace, which will \nbring understanding of each other. \nThe problem is this. Seeing that conflict is destructive, wasteful, why is it that \nin each of us there is contradiction? To understand that, we must go a little \nfurther. Why is there the sense of opposing desires? I do not know if we are \naware of it in ourselves—this contradiction, this sense of wanting and not \nwanting, remembering something and trying to forget it in order to find \nsomething new. Just watch it. It is very simple and very normal. It is not \nsomething extraordinary. The fact is, there is contradiction. Then why does this \ncontradiction arise? \nWhat do we mean by contradiction? Does it not imply an impermanent state \nwhich is being opposed by another impermanent state? I think I have a \npermanent desire, I posit in myself a permanent desire and another desire arises \nwhich contradicts it; this contradiction brings about conflict, which is waste. That \nis to say there is a constant denial of one desire by another desire, one pursuit \novercoming another pursuit. Now, is there such a thing as a permanent desire? \nSurely, all desire is impermanent—not metaphysically, but actually. I want a job. \nThat is I look to a certain job as a means of happiness; and when I get it, I am \ndissatisfied. I want to become the manager, then the owner, and so on and on, not \nonly in this world, but in the so-called spiritual world—the teacher becoming the \nprincipal, the priest becoming the bishop, the pupil becoming the master."

    "text": "This constant becoming, arriving at one state after another, brings about \ncontradiction, does it not? Therefore, why not look at life not as one permanent \ndesire but as a series of fleeting desires always in opposition to each other? \nHence the mind need not be in a state of contradiction. If I regard life not as a \npermanent desire but as a series of temporary desires which are constantly \nchanging, then there is no contradiction. \nContradiction arises only when the mind has a fixed point of desire; that is \nwhen the mind does not regard all desire as moving, transient, but seizes upon \none desire and makes that into a permanency—only then, when other desires \narise, is there contradiction. But all desires are in constant movement, there is no \nfixation of desire. There is no fixed point in desire; but the mind establishes a \nfixed point because it treats everything as a means to arrive, to gain; and there \nmust be contradiction, conflict, as long as one is arriving. You want to arrive, \nyou want to succeed, you want to find an ultimate God or truth which will be \nyour permanent satisfaction. Therefore you are not seeking truth, you are not \nseeking God. You are seeking lasting gratification, and that gratification you \nclothe with an idea, a respectable-sounding word such as God, truth; but actually \nwe are all seeking gratification, and we place that gratification, that satisfaction, \nat the highest point, calling it God, and the lowest point is drink. So long as the \nmind is seeking gratification, there is not much difference between God and \ndrink. Socially, drink may be bad; but the inward desire for gratification, for \ngain, is even more harmful, is it not? If you really want to find truth, you must be \nextremely honest, not merely at the verbal level but altogether; you must be \nextraordinarily clear, and you cannot be clear if you are unwilling to face facts. \nNow what brings about contradiction in each one of us? Surely it is the desire \nto become something, is it not? We all want to become something: to become \nsuccessful in the world and, inwardly, to achieve a result. So long as we think in \nterms of time, in terms of achievement, in terms of position, there must be \ncontradiction. After all, the mind is the product of time. Thought is based on \nyesterday, on the past; and so long as thought is functioning within the field of \ntime, thinking in terms of the future, of becoming, gaining, achieving, there must \nbe contradiction, because then we are incapable of facing exactly what is. Only in \nrealizing, in understanding, in being choicelessly aware of what is, is there a \npossibility of freedom from that disintegrating factor which is contradiction. \nTherefore it is essential, is it not?, to understand the whole process of our \nthinking, for it is there that we find contradiction. Thought itself has become a \ncontradiction because we have not understood the total process of ourselves; and \nthat understanding is possible only when we are fully aware of our thought, not \nas an observer operating upon his thought, but integrally and without choice—\nwhich is extremely arduous. Then only is there the dissolution of that \ncontradiction which is so detrimental, so painful. \nSo long as we are trying to achieve a psychological result, so long as we want \ninward security, there must be a contradiction in our life. I do not think that most \nof us are aware of this contradiction; or, if we are, we do not see its real \nsignificance. On the contrary, contradiction gives us an impetus to live; the very \nelement of friction makes us feel that we are alive. The effort, the struggle of"

So long as there is the desire to achieve a \nresult, which is the desire to be psychologically secure, there must be a \ncontradiction; and where there is contradiction, there cannot be a quiet mind. \nQuietness of mind is essential to understand the whole significance of life. \nThought can never be tranquil; thought, which is the product of time, can never \nfind that which is timeless, can never know that which is beyond time. The very \nnature of our thinking is a contradiction, because we are always thinking in terms \nof the past or of the future; therefore we are never fully cognizant, fully aware of \nthe present. \nTo be fully aware of the present is an extraordinarily difficult task because the \nmind is incapable of facing a fact directly without deception. Thought is the \nproduct of the past and therefore it can only think in terms of the past or the \nfuture; it cannot be completely aware of a fact in the present. So long as thought, \nwhich is the product of the past, tries to eliminate contradiction and all the \nproblems that it creates, it is merely pursuing a result, trying to achieve an end, \nand such thinking only creates more contradiction and hence conflict, misery and \nconfusion in us and, therefore, about us. \nTo be free of contradiction, one must be aware of the present without choice. \nHow can there be choice when you are confronted with a fact? Surely the \nunderstanding of the fact is made impossible so long as thought is trying to \noperate upon the fact in terms of becoming, changing, altering. Therefore self-\nknowledge is the beginning of understanding; without self-knowledge, \ncontradiction and conflict will continue. To know the whole process, the totality \nof oneself, does not require any expert, any authority. The pursuit of authority \nonly breeds fear. No expert, no specialist, can show us how to understand the \nprocess of the self. One has to study it for oneself. You and I can help each other \nby talking about it, but none can unfold it for us, no specialist, no teacher, can \nexplore it for us. We can be aware of it only in our relationship—in our \nrelationship to things, to property, to people and to ideas. In relationship we shall \ndiscover that contradiction arises when action is approximating itself to an idea. \nThe idea is merely the crystallization of thought as a symbol, and the effort to \nlive up to the symbol brings about a contradiction. \nThus, so long as there is a pattern of thought, contradiction will continue; to \nput an end to the pattern, and so to contradiction, there must be self-knowledge. \nThis understanding of the self is not a process reserved for the few. The self is to \nbe understood in our everyday speech, in the way we think and feel, in the way \nwe look at another. If we can be aware of every thought, of every feeling, from \nmoment to moment, then we shall see that in relationship the ways of the self are \nunderstood. Then only is there a possibility of that tranquillity of mind in which \nalone the ultimate reality can come into being."

By that, I mean the idea, the memory, \nthe conclusion, the experience, the various forms of nameable and unnameable \nintentions, the conscious endeavour to be or not to be, the accumulated memory \nof the unconscious, the racial, the group, the individual, the clan, and the whole \nof it all, whether it is projected outwardly in action or projected spiritually as \nvirtue; the striving after all this is the self. In it is included the competition, the \ndesire to be. The whole process of that is the self; and we know actually when we \nare faced with it that it is an evil thing. I am using the word ‘evil’ intentionally, \nbecause the self is dividing: the self is self-enclosing: its activities, however \nnoble, are separative and isolating. We know all this. We also know those \nextraordinary moments when the self is not there, in which there is no sense of \nendeavour, of effort, and which happens when there is love. \nIt seems to me that it is important to understand how experience strengthens \nthe self. If we are earnest, we should understand this problem of experience. Now \nwhat do we mean by experience? We have experience all the time, impressions; \nand we translate those impressions, and we react or act according to them; we are \ncalculating, cunning, and so on. There is the constant interplay between what is \nseen objectively and our reaction to it, and interplay between the conscious and \nthe memories of the unconscious. \nAccording to my memories, I react to whatever I see, to whatever I feel. In \nthis process of reacting to what I see, what I feel, what I know, what I believe, \nexperience is taking place, is it not? Reaction, response to something seen, is \nexperience. When I see you, I react; the naming of that reaction is experience. If I \ndo not name that reaction it is not an experience. Watch your own responses and \nwhat is taking place about you. There is no experience unless there is a naming \nprocess going on at the same time. If I do not recognize you, how can I have the \nexperience of meeting you? It sounds simple and right. Is it not a fact? That is if I \ndo not react according to my memories, according to my conditioning, according \nto my prejudices, how can I know that I have had an experience? \nThen there is the projection of various desires. I desire to be protected, to \nhave security inwardly; or I desire to have a Master, a guru, a teacher, a God; and \nI experience that which I have projected; that is I have projected a desire which \nhas taken a form, to which I have given a name; to that I react. It is my \nprojection. It is my naming. That desire which gives me an experience makes me \nsay: “I have experience”, “I have met the Master”, or “I have not met the \nMaster”. You know the whole process of naming an experience. Desire is what \nyou call experience, is it not? \nWhen I desire silence of the mind, what is taking place? What happens? I see \nthe importance of having a silent mind, a quiet mind, for various reasons; \nbecause the Upanishads have said so, religious scriptures have said so, saints \nhave said it, and also occasionally I myself feel how good it is to be quiet, \nbecause my mind is so very chatty all the day. At times I feel how nice, how \npleasurable it is to have a peaceful mind, a silent mind. The desire is to"

So through discipline I seek to experience silence. The self, the ‘me’, \nhas therefore established itself in the experience of silence. \nI want to understand what is truth; that is my desire, my longing; then there \nfollows my projection of what I consider to be the truth, because I have read lots \nabout it; I have heard many people talk about it; religious scriptures have \ndescribed it. I want all that. What happens? The very want, the very desire is \nprojected, and I experience because I recognize that projected state. If I did not \nrecognize that state, I would not call it truth. I recognize it and I experience it; \nand that experience gives strength to the self, to the ‘me’, does it not? So the self \nbecomes entrenched in the experience. Then you say “I know”, “the Master \nexists”, “there is God” or “there is no God”; you say that a particular political \nsystem is right and all others are not. \nSo experience is always strengthening the ‘me’. The more you are entrenched \nin your experience, the more does the self get strengthened. As a result of this, \nyou have a certain strength of character, strength of knowledge, of belief, which \nyou display to other people because you know they are not as clever as you are, \nand because you have the gift of the pen or of speech and you are cunning. \nBecause the self is still acting, so your beliefs, your Masters, your castes, your \neconomic system are all a process of isolation, and they therefore bring \ncontention. You must, if you are at all serious or earnest in this, dissolve this \ncentre completely and not justify it. That is why we must understand the process \nof experience. \nIs it possible for the mind, for the self, not to project, not to desire, not to \nexperience? We see that all experiences of the self are a negation, a destruction, \nand yet we call them positive action, don’t we? That is what we call the positive \nway of life. To undo this whole process is, to you, negation. Are you right in \nthat? Can we, you and I, as individuals, go to the root of it and understand the \nprocess of the self? Now what brings about dissolution of the self? Religious and \nother groups have offered identification, have they not? “Identify yourself with a \nlarger, and the self disappears”, is what they say. But surely identification is still \nthe process of the self; the larger is simply the projection of the ‘me’, which I \nexperience and which therefore strengthens the ‘me’. \nAll the various forms of discipline, belief and knowledge surely only \nstrengthen the self. Can we find an element which will dissolve the self? Or is \nthat a wrong question? That is what we want basically. We want to find \nsomething which will dissolve the ‘me’, do we not? We think there are various \nmeans, namely, identification, belief, etc.; but all of them are at the same level; \none is not superior to the other, because all of them are equally powerful in \nstrengthening the self, the ‘me’. So can I see the ‘me’ wherever it functions, and \nsee its destructive forces and energy? Whatever name I may give to it, it is an \nisolating force, it is a destructive force, and I want to find a way of dissolving it. \nYou must have asked this yourself—“I see the ‘I’ functioning all the time and \nalways bringing anxiety, fear, frustration, despair, misery, not only to myself but \nto all around me.

I do not want to be partially intelligent but intelligent \nin an integrated manner. Most of us are intelligent in layers, you probably in one \nway and I in some other way. Some of you are intelligent in your business work, \nsome others in your office work, and so on; people are intelligent in different \nways; but we are not integrally intelligent. To be integrally intelligent means to \nbe without the self. Is it possible? \nIs it possible for the self to be completely absent now? You know it is \npossible. What are the necessary ingredients, requirements? What is the element \nthat brings it about? Can I find it? When I put that question “Can I find it?” \nsurely I am convinced that it is possible; so I have already created an experience \nin which the self is going to be strengthened, is it not? Understanding of the self \nrequires a great deal of intelligence, a great deal of watchfulness, alertness, \nwatching ceaselessly, so that it does not slip away. I, who am very earnest, want \nto dissolve the self. When I say that, I know it is possible to dissolve the self. The \nmoment I say “I want to dissolve this”, in that there is still the experiencing of \nthe self; and so the self is strengthened. So how is it possible for the self not to \nexperience? One can see that the state of creation is not at all the experience of \nthe self. Creation is when the self is not there, because creation is not intellectual, \nis not of the mind, is not self-projected, is something beyond all experiencing. So \nis it possible for the mind to be quite still, in a state of non-recognition, or non-\nexperiencing, to be in a state in which creation can take place, which means \nwhen the self is not there, when the self is absent? The problem is this, is it not? \nAny movement of the mind, positive or negative, is an experience which actually \nstrengthens the ‘me’. Is it possible for the mind not to recognize? That can only \ntake place when there is complete silence, but not the silence which is an \nexperience of the self and which therefore strengthens the self. \nIs there an entity apart from the self, which looks at the self and dissolves the \nself? Is there a spiritual entity which supercedes the self and destroys it, which \nputs it aside? We think there is, don’t we? Most religious people think there is \nsuch an element. The materialist says, “It is impossible for the self to be \ndestroyed; it can only be conditioned and restrained—politically, economically \nand socially; we can hold it firmly within a certain pattern and we can break it; \nand therefore it can be made to lead a high life, a moral life, and not to interfere \nwith anything but to follow the social pattern, and to function merely as a \nmachine”. That we know. There are other people, the so-called religious ones—\nthey are not really religious, though we call them so—who say, “Fundamentally, \nthere is such an element. If we can get into touch with it, it will dissolve the self”. \nIs there such an element to dissolve the self? Please see what we are doing. \nWe are forcing the self into a corner. If you allow yourself to be forced into the \ncorner, you will see what will happen. We should like there to be an element \nwhich is timeless, which is not of the self, which, we hope, will come and \nintercede and destroy the self—and which we call God. Now is there such a thing \nwhich the mind can conceive? There may be or there may not be; that is not the \npoint. But when the mind seeks a timeless spiritual state which will go into action \nin order to destroy the self, is that not another form of experience which is"

When you believe that there is truth, God, the timeless state, immortality, \nis that not the process of strengthening the self? The self has projected that thing \nwhich you feel and believe will come and destroy the self. So, having projected \nthis idea of continuance in a timeless state as a spiritual entity, you have an \nexperience; and such experience only strengthens the self; and therefore what \nhave you done? You have not really destroyed the self but only given it a \ndifferent name, a different quality; the self is still there, because you have \nexperienced it. Thus our action from the beginning to the end is the same action, \nonly we think it is evolving, growing, becoming more and more beautiful; but, if \nyou observe inwardly, it is the same action going on, the same ‘me’ functioning \nat different levels with different labels, different names. \nWhen you see the whole process, the cunning, extraordinary inventions, the \nintelligence of the self, how it covers itself up through identification, through \nvirtue, through experience, through belief, through knowledge; when you see that \nthe mind is moving in a circle, in a cage of its own making, what happens? When \nyou are aware of it, fully cognizant of it, then are you not extraordinarily quiet—\nnot through compulsion, not through any reward, not through any fear? When \nyou recognize that every movement of the mind is merely a form of \nstrengthening the self, when you observe it, see it, when you are completely \naware of it in action, when you come to that point—not ideologically, verbally, \nnot through projected experiencing, but when you are actually in that state—then \nyou will see that the mind, being utterly still, has no power of creating. Whatever \nthe mind creates is in a circle, within the field of the self. When the mind is non-\ncreating there is creation, which is not a recognizable process. \nReality, truth, is not to be recognized. For truth to come, belief, knowledge, \nexperiencing, the pursuit of virtue—all this must go. The virtuous person who is \nconscious of pursuing virtue can never find reality. He may be a very decent \nperson; but that is entirely different from being a man of truth, a man who \nunderstands. To the man of truth, truth has come into being. A virtuous man is a \nrighteous man, and a righteous man can never understand what is truth because \nvirtue to him is the covering of the self, the strengthening of the self, because he \nis pursuing virtue. When he says “I must be without greed”, the state of non-\ngreed which he experiences only strengthens the self. That is why it is so \nimportant to be poor, not only in the things of the world but also in belief and in \nknowledge. A man with worldly riches or a man rich in knowledge and belief \nwill never know anything but darkness, and will be the centre of all mischief and \nmisery. But if you and I, as individuals, can see this whole working of the self, \nthen we shall know what love is. I assure you that is the only reformation which \ncan possibly change the world. Love is not of the self. Self cannot recognize \nlove. You say “I love”; but then, in the very saying of it, in the very experiencing \nof it, love is not. But, when you know love, self is not. When there is love, self is \nnot."

How \ncan I be afraid of death, how can I be afraid of something I do not know? I can be \nafraid only of what I know. When I say I am afraid of death, am I really afraid of \nthe unknown, which is death, or am I afraid of losing what I have known? My \nfear is not of death but of losing my association with things belonging to me. My \nfear is always in relation to the known, not to the unknown. \nMy inquiry now is how to be free from the fear of the known, which is the \nfear of losing my family, my reputation, my character, my bank account, my \nappetites and so on. You may say that fear arises from conscience; but your \nconscience is formed by your conditioning, so conscience is still the result of the \nknown. What do I know? Knowledge is having ideas, having opinions about \nthings, having a sense of continuity as in relation to the known, and no more. \nIdeas are memories, the result of experience, which is response to challenge. I am \nafraid of the known, which means I am afraid of losing people, things or ideas, I \nam afraid of discovering what I am, afraid of being at a loss, afraid of the pain \nwhich might come into being when I have lost or have not gained or have no \nmore pleasure. \nThere is fear of pain. Physical pain is a nervous response, but psychological \npain arises when I hold on to things that give me satisfaction, for then I am afraid \nof anyone or anything that may take them away from me. The psychological \naccumulations prevent psychological pain as long as they are undisturbed; that is \nI am a bundle of accumulations, experiences, which prevent any serious form of \ndisturbance—and I do not want to be disturbed. Therefore I am afraid of anyone \nwho disturbs them. Thus my fear is of the known, I am afraid of the \naccumulations, physical or psychological, that I have gathered as a means of \nwarding off pain or preventing sorrow. But sorrow is in the very process of \naccumulating to ward off psychological pain. Knowledge also helps to prevent \npain. As medical knowledge helps to prevent physical pain, so beliefs help to \nprevent psychological pain, and that is why I am afraid of losing my beliefs, \nthough I have no perfect knowledge or concrete proof of the reality of such \nbeliefs. I may reject some of the traditional beliefs that have been foisted on me \nbecause my own experience gives me strength, confidence, understanding; but \nsuch beliefs and the knowledge which I have acquired are basically the same—a \nmeans of warding off pain. \nFear exists so long as there is accumulation of the known, which creates the \nfear of losing. Therefore fear of the unknown is really fear of losing the \naccumulated known. Accumulation invariably means fear, which in turn means \npain; and the moment I say “I must not lose” there is fear. Though my intention \nin accumulating is to ward off pain, pain is inherent in the process of \naccumulation. The very things which I have create fear, which is pain. \nThe seed of defence brings offence. I want physical security; thus I create a \nsovereign government, which necessitates armed forces, which means war, \nwhich destroys security.

When I see the fallacy of demanding security I do not accumulate any more. \nIf you say that you see it but you cannot help accumulating, it is because you do \nnot really see that, inherently, in accumulation there is pain. \nFear exists in the process of accumulation and belief in something is part of \nthe accumulative process. My son dies, and I believe in reincarnation to prevent \nme psychologically from having more pain; but, in the very process of believing, \nthere is doubt. Outwardly I accumulate things, and bring war; inwardly I \naccumulate beliefs, and bring pain. So long as I want to be secure, to have bank \naccounts, pleasures and so on, so long as I want to become something, \nphysiologically or psychologically, there must be pain. The very things I am \ndoing to ward off pain bring me fear, pain. \nFear comes into being when I desire to be in a particular pattern. To live \nwithout fear means to live without a particular pattern. When I demand a \nparticular way of living that in itself is a source of fear. My difficulty is my \ndesire to live in a certain frame. Can I not break the frame? I can do so only when \nI see the truth: that the frame is causing fear and that this fear is strengthening the \nframe. If I say I must break the frame because I want to be free of fear, then I am \nmerely following another pattern which will cause further fear. Any action on my \npart based on the desire to break the frame will only create another pattern, and \ntherefore fear. How am I to break the frame without causing fear, that is without \nany conscious or unconscious action on my part with regard to it? This means \nthat I must not act, I must make no movement to break the frame. What happens \nto me when I am simply looking at the frame without doing anything about it? I \nsee that the mind itself is the frame, the pattern; it lives in the habitual pattern \nwhich it has created for itself. Therefore, the mind itself is fear. Whatever the \nmind does goes towards strengthening an old pattern or furthering a new one. \nThis means that whatever the mind does to get rid of fear causes fear. \nFear finds various escapes. The common variety is identification, is it not?—\nidentification with the country, with the society, with an idea. Haven’t you \nnoticed how you respond when you see a procession, a military procession or a \nreligious procession, or when the country is in danger of being invaded? You \nthen identify yourself with the country, with a being, with an ideology. There are \nother times when you identify yourself with your child, with your wife, with a \nparticular form of action, or inaction. Identification is a process of self-\nforgetfulness. So long as I am conscious of the ‘me’ I know there is pain, there is \nstruggle, there is constant fear. But if I can identify myself with something \ngreater, with something worthwhile, with beauty, with life, with truth, with \nbelief, with knowledge, at least temporarily, there is an escape from the ‘me’, is \nthere not? If I talk about “my country” I forget myself temporarily, do I not? If I \ncan say something about God, I forget myself. If I can identify myself with my \nfamily, with a group, with a particular party, with a certain ideology, then there is \na temporary escape. \nIdentification therefore is a form of escape from the self, even as virtue is a \nform of escape from the self. The man who pursues virtue is escaping from the \nself and he has a narrow mind. That is not a virtuous mind, for virtue is \nsomething which cannot be pursued.

Is it not the non-acceptance of what is? We \nmust understand the word ‘acceptance’. I am not using that word as meaning the \neffort made to accept.

We seem to think that simplicity is merely an outward \nexpression, a withdrawal: having few possessions, wearing a loincloth, having no \nhome, putting on few clothes, having a small bank account. Surely that is not \nsimplicity. That is merely an outward show. It seems to me that simplicity is \nessential; but simplicity can come into being only when we begin to understand \nthe significance of self-knowledge. \nSimplicity is not merely adjustment to a pattern. It requires a great deal of \nintelligence to be simple and not merely conform to a particular pattern, however \nworthy outwardly. Unfortunately most of us begin by being simple externally, in \noutward things. It is comparatively easy to have few things and to be satisfied \nwith few things; to be content with little and perhaps to share that little with \nothers. But a mere outward expression of simplicity in things, in possessions, \nsurely does not imply the simplicity of inward being. Because, as the world is at \npresent, more and more things are being urged upon us, outwardly, externally. \nLife is becoming more and more complex. In order to escape from that, we try to \nrenounce or be detached from things—from cars, from houses, from \norganizations, from cinemas, and from the innumerable circumstances outwardly \nthrust upon us. We think we shall be simple by withdrawing. A great many \nsaints, a great many teachers, have renounced the world; and it seems to me that \nsuch a renunciation on the part of any of us does not solve the problem. \nSimplicity which is fundamental, real, can only come into being inwardly; and \nfrom that there is an outward expression. How to be simple, then, is the problem; \nbecause that simplicity makes one more and more sensitive. A sensitive mind, a \nsensitive heart, is essential, for then it is capable of quick perception, quick \nreception. \nOne can be inwardly simple, surely, only by understanding the innumerable \nimpediments, attachments, fears, in which one is held. But most of us like to be \nheld—by people, by possessions, by ideas. We like to be prisoners. Inwardly we \nare prisoners, though outwardly we seem to be very simple. Inwardly we are \nprisoners to our desires, to our wants, to our ideals, to innumerable motivations. \nSimplicity cannot be found unless one is free inwardly. Therefore it must begin \ninwardly, not outwardly. \nThere is an extraordinary freedom when one understands the whole process of \nbelief, why the mind is attached to a belief. When there is freedom from beliefs, \nthere is simplicity. But that simplicity requires intelligence, and to be intelligent \none must be aware of one’s own impediments. To be aware, one must be \nconstantly on the watch, not established in any particular groove, in any \nparticular pattern of thought or action. After all, what one is inwardly does affect \nthe outer. Society, or any form of action, is the projection of ourselves, and \nwithout transforming inwardly mere legislation has very little significance \noutwardly; it may bring about certain reforms, certain adjustments, but what one \nis inwardly always overcomes the outer.

The outward expression is only an indication of \nour inward state, but to understand the inward state one must approach through \nthe outer. Most of us do that. In understanding the inner—not exclusively, not by \nrejecting the outer, but by understanding the outer and so coming upon the \ninner—we will find that, as we proceed to investigate the inward complexities of \nour being, we become more and more sensitive, free. It is this inward simplicity \nthat is so essential, because that simplicity creates sensitivity. A mind that is not \nsensitive, not alert, not aware, is incapable of any receptivity, any creative action. \nConformity as a means of making ourselves simple really makes the mind and \nheart dull, insensitive. Any form of authoritarian compulsion, imposed by the \ngovernment, by oneself, by the ideal of achievement, and so on—any form of \nconformity must make for insensitivity, for not being simple inwardly. \nOutwardly you may conform and give the appearance of simplicity, as so many \nreligious people do. They practise various disciplines, join various organizations, \nmeditate in a particular fashion, and so on—all giving an appearance of \nsimplicity, but such conformity does not make for simplicity. Compulsion of any \nkind can never lead to simplicity. On the contrary, the more you suppress, the \nmore you substitute, the more you sublimate, the less there is simplicity, but the \nmore you understand the process of sublimation, suppression, substitution, the \ngreater the possibility of being simple. \nOur problems—social, environmental, political, religious—are so complex \nthat we can solve them only by being simple, not by becoming extraordinarily \nerudite and clever. A simple person sees much more directly, has a more direct \nexperience, than the complex person. Our minds are so crowded with an infinite \nknowledge of facts, of what others have said, that we have become incapable of \nbeing simple and having direct experience ourselves. These problems demand a \nnew approach; and they can be so approached only when we are simple, inwardly \nreally simple. That simplicity comes only through self-knowledge, through \nunderstanding ourselves; the ways of our thinking and feeling; the movements of \nour thoughts; our responses; how we conform, through fear, to public opinion, to \nwhat others say, what the Buddha, the Christ, the great saints have said—all of \nwhich indicates our nature to conform, to be safe, to be secure. When one is \nseeking security, one is obviously in a state of fear and therefore there is no \nsimplicity. \nWithout being simple, one cannot be sensitive—to the trees, to the birds, to \nthe mountains, to the wind, to all the things which are going on about us in the \nworld; if one is not simple one cannot be sensitive to the inward intimation of \nthings. Most of us live so superficially, on the upper level of our consciousness; \nthere we try to be thoughtful or intelligent, which is synonymous with being \nreligious; there we try to make our minds simple, through compulsion, through"

To be simple in the whole, total process of our consciousness is extremely \narduous; because there must be no inward reservation, there must be an eagerness \nto find out, to inquire into the process of our being, which means to be awake to \nevery intimation, to every hint; to be aware of our fears, of our hopes, and to \ninvestigate and to be free of them more and more and more. Only then, when the \nmind and the heart are really simple, not encrusted, are we able to solve the many \nproblems that confront us. \nKnowledge is not going to solve our problems. You may know, for example, \nthat there is reincarnation, that there is a continuity after death. You may know, I \ndon’t say you do; or you may be convinced of it. But that does not solve the \nproblem. Death cannot be shelved by your theory, or by information, or by \nconviction. It is much more mysterious, much deeper, much more creative than \nthat. \nOne must have the capacity to investigate all these things anew; because it is \nonly through direct experience that our problems are solved, and to have direct \nexperience there must be simplicity, which means there must be sensitivity. A \nmind is made dull by the weight of knowledge. A mind is made dull by the past, \nby the future. Only a mind that is capable of adjusting itself to the present, \ncontinually, from moment to moment, can meet the powerful influences and \npressures constantly put upon us by our environment. \nThus a religious man is not really one who puts on a robe or a loincloth, or \nlives on one meal a day, or has taken innumerable vows to be this and not to be \nthat, but is he who is inwardly simple, who is not becoming anything. Such a \nmind is capable of extraordinary receptivity, because there is no barrier, there is \nno fear, there is no going towards something; therefore it is capable of receiving \ngrace, God, truth, or what you will. But a mind that is pursuing reality is not a \nsimple mind. A mind that is seeking out, searching, groping, agitated, is not a \nsimple mind. A mind that conforms to any pattern of authority, inward or \noutward, cannot be sensitive. And it is only when a mind is really sensitive, alert, \naware of all its own happenings, responses, thoughts, when it is no longer \nbecoming, is no longer shaping itself to be something—only then is it capable of \nreceiving that which is truth. It is only then that there can be happiness, for \nhappiness is not an end—it is the result of reality. When the mind and the heart \nhave become simple and therefore sensitive—not through any form of \ncompulsion, direction, or imposition—then we shall see that our problems can be \ntackled very simply. However complex our problems, we shall be able to \napproach them freshly and see them differently. That is what is wanted at the \npresent time: people who are capable of meeting this outward confusion, turmoil, \nantagonism anew, creatively, simply—not with theories nor formulas, either of \nthe left or of the right. You cannot meet it anew if you are not simple. \nA problem can be solved only when we approach it thus. We cannot approach \nit anew if we are thinking in terms of certain patterns of thought, religious, \npolitical or otherwise. So we must be free of all these things, to be simple. That is \nwhy it is so important to be aware, to have the capacity to understand the process"

That is our life—life being relationship to the whole. Does the \nunderstanding of that relationship demand specialization? Obviously not. What it \ndemands is awareness to meet life as a whole. How is one to be aware? That is \nour problem. How is one to have that awareness—if I may use this word without \nmaking it mean specialization? How is one to be capable of meeting life as a \nwhole?—which means not only personal relationship with your neighbour but \nalso with nature, with the things that you possess, with ideas, and with the things \nthat the mind manufactures as illusion, desire and so on. How is one to be aware \nof this whole process of relationship? Surely that is our life, is it not? There is no \nlife without relationship; and to understand this relationship does not mean \nisolation. On the contrary, it demands a full recognition or awareness of the total \nprocess of relationship. \nHow is one to be aware? How are we aware of anything? How are you aware \nof your relationship with a person? How are you aware of the trees, the call of a \nbird? How are you aware of your reactions when you read a newspaper? Are we \naware of the superficial responses of the mind, as well as the inner responses? \nHow are we aware of anything? First we are aware, are we not?, of a response to \na stimulus, which is an obvious fact; I see the trees, and there is a response, then \nsensation, contact, identification and desire. That is the ordinary process, isn’t it? \nWe can observe what actually takes place, without studying any books. So \nthrough identification you have pleasure and pain. And our ‘capacity’ is this \nconcern with pleasure and the avoidance of pain, is it not? If you are interested in \nsomething, if it gives you pleasure, there is ‘capacity’ immediately; there is an \nawareness of that fact immediately; and if it is painful the ‘capacity’ is developed \nto avoid it. So long as we are looking to ‘capacity’ to understand ourselves, I \nthink we shall fail; because the understanding of ourselves does not depend on \ncapacity. It is not a technique that you develop, cultivate and increase through \ntime, through constantly sharpening. This awareness of oneself can be tested, \nsurely, in the action of relationship; it can be tested in the way we talk, the way \nwe behave. Watch yourself without any identification, without any comparison, \nwithout any condemnation; just watch, and you will see an extraordinary thing \ntaking place. You not only put an end to an activity which is unconscious—\nbecause most of our activities are unconscious—you not only bring that to an \nend, but, further, you are aware of the motives of that action, without inquiry, \nwithout digging into it. \nWhen you are aware, you see the whole process of your thinking and action; \nbut it can happen only when there is no condemnation. When I condemn \nsomething, I do not understand it, and it is one way of avoiding any kind of \nunderstanding. I think most of us do that purposely; we condemn immediately \nand we think we have understood. If we do not condemn but regard it, are aware \nof it, then the content, the significance of that action begins to open up."

On \nthe contrary, it has the quality of passivity which is direct action; and you will \ndiscover this, if you experiment with it. \nAfter all, if you want to understand something, you have to be in a passive \nmood, do you not? You cannot keep on thinking about it, speculating about it or \nquestioning it. You have to be sensitive enough to receive the content of it. It is \nlike being a sensitive photographic plate. If I want to understand you, I have to be \npassively aware; then you begin to tell me all your story. Surely that is not a \nquestion of capacity or specialization. In that process we begin to understand \nourselves—not only the superficial layers of our consciousness, but the deeper, \nwhich is much more important; because there are all our motives and intentions, \nour hidden, confused demands, anxieties, fears, appetites. Outwardly we may \nhave them all under control but inwardly they are boiling. Until those have been \ncompletely understood through awareness, obviously there cannot be freedom, \nthere cannot be happiness, there is no intelligence. \nIs intelligence a matter of specialization?—intelligence being the total \nawareness of our process. And is that intelligence to be cultivated through any \nform of specialization? Because that is what is happening, is it not? The priest, \nthe doctor, the engineer, the industrialist, the businessman, the professor—we \nhave the mentality of all that specialization. \nTo realize the highest form of intelligence—which is truth, which is God, \nwhich cannot be described—to realize that, we think we have to make ourselves \nspecialists. We study, we grope, we search out; and, with the mentality of the \nspecialist or looking to the specialist, we study ourselves in order to develop a \ncapacity which will help to unravel our conflicts, our miseries. \nOur problem is, if we are at all aware, whether the conflicts and the miseries \nand the sorrows of our daily existence can be solved by another; and if they \ncannot, how is it possible for us to tackle them? To understand a problem \nobviously requires a certain intelligence, and that intelligence cannot be derived \nfrom or cultivated through specialization. It comes into being only when we are \npassively aware of the whole process of our consciousness, which is to be aware \nof ourselves without choice, without choosing what is right and what is wrong. \nWhen you are passively aware, you will see that out of that passivity—which is \nnot idleness, which is not sleep, but extreme alertness—the problem has quite a \ndifferent significance; which means there is no longer identification with the \nproblem and therefore there is no judgement and hence the problem begins to \nreveal its content. If you are able to do that constantly, continuously, then every \nproblem can be solved fundamentally, not superficially. That is the difficulty, \nbecause most of us are incapable of being passively aware, letting the problem \ntell the story without our interpreting it. We do not know how to look at a \nproblem dispassionately. We are not capable of it, unfortunately, because we \nwant a result from the problem, we want an answer, we are looking to an end; or \nwe try to translate the problem according to our pleasure or pain; or we have an \nanswer already on how to deal with the problem. Therefore we approach a \nproblem, which is always new, with the old pattern. The challenge is always the"

The problem is always a problem of \nrelationship—with things, with people or with ideas; there is no other problem; \nand to meet the problem of relationship, with its constantly varying demands—to \nmeet it rightly, to meet it adequately—one has to be aware passively. This \npassivity is not a question of determination, of will, of discipline; to be aware \nthat we are not passive is the beginning. To be aware that we want a particular \nanswer to a particular problem—surely that is the beginning: to know ourselves \nin relationship to the problem and how we deal with the problem. Then as we \nbegin to know ourselves in relationship to the problem—how we respond, what \nare our various prejudices, demands, pursuits, in meeting that problem—this \nawareness will reveal the process of our own thinking, of our own inward nature; \nand in that there is a release. \nWhat is important, surely, is to be aware without choice, because choice \nbrings about conflict. The chooser is in confusion, therefore he chooses; if he is \nnot in confusion, there is no choice. Only the person who is confused chooses \nwhat he shall do or shall not do. The man who is clear and simple does not \nchoose; what is, is. Action based on an idea is obviously the action of choice and \nsuch action is not liberating; on the contrary, it only creates further resistance, \nfurther conflict, according to that conditioned thinking. \nThe important thing, therefore, is to be aware from moment to moment \nwithout accumulating the experience which awareness brings; because, the \nmoment you accumulate, you are aware only according to that accumulation, \naccording to that pattern, according to that experience. That is your awareness is \nconditioned by your accumulation and therefore there is no longer observation \nbut merely translation. Where there is translation, there is choice, and choice \ncreates conflict; in conflict there can be no understanding. \nLife is a matter of relationship; and to understand that relationship, which is \nnot static, there must be an awareness which is pliable, an awareness which is \nalertly passive, not aggressively active. As I said, this passive awareness does not \ncome through any form of discipline, through any practice. It is to be just aware, \nfrom moment to moment, of our thinking and feeling, not only when we are \nawake; for we shall see, as we go into it more deeply, that we begin to dream, \nthat we begin to throw up all kinds of symbols which we translate as dreams. \nThus we open the door into the hidden, which becomes the known; but to find \nthe unknown, we must go beyond the door—surely, that is our difficulty. Reality \nis not a thing which is knowable by the mind, because the mind is the result of \nthe known, of the past; therefore the mind must understand itself and its \nfunctioning, its truth, and only then is it possible for the unknown to be."

Now, \nwhat is desire? What is this thing that is urging, compelling us? I am not \nsuggesting that we should be satisfied with what we have or with what we are, \nwhich is merely the opposite of what we want. We are trying to see what desire \nis, and if we can go into it tentatively, hesitantly, I think we shall bring about a \ntransformation which is not a mere substitution of one object of desire for \nanother object of desire. This is generally what we mean by ‘change’, is it not? \nBeing dissatisfied with one particular object of desire, we find a substitute for it. \nWe are everlastingly moving from one object of desire to another which we \nconsider to be higher, nobler, more refined; but, however refined, desire is still \ndesire, and in this movement of desire there is endless struggle, the conflict of the \nopposites. \nIs it not, therefore, important to find out what is desire and whether it can be \ntransformed? What is desire? Is it not the symbol and its sensation? Desire is \nsensation with the object of its attainment. Is there desire without a symbol and \nits sensation? Obviously not. The symbol may be a picture, a person, a word, a \nname, an image, an idea which gives me a sensation, which makes me feel that I \nlike or dislike it; if the sensation is pleasurable, I want to attain, to possess, to \nhold on to its symbol and continue in that pleasure. From time to time, according \nto my inclinations and intensities, I change the picture, the image, the object. \nWith one form of pleasure I am fed up, tired, bored, so I seek a new sensation, a \nnew idea, a new symbol. I reject the old sensation and take on a new one, with \nnew words, new significances, new experiences. I resist the old and yield to the \nnew which I consider to be higher, nobler, more satisfying. Thus in desire there is \na resistance and a yielding, which involves temptation; and of course in yielding \nto a particular symbol of desire there is always the fear of frustration. \nIf I observe the whole process of desire in myself I see that there is always an \nobject towards which my mind is directed for further sensation, and that in this \nprocess there is involved resistance, temptation and discipline. There is \nperception, sensation, contact and desire, and the mind becomes the mechanical \ninstrument of this process, in which symbols words, objects are the centre round \nwhich all desire, all pursuits, all ambitions are built; that centre is the ‘me’. Can I \ndissolve that centre of desire—not one particular desire, one particular appetite or \ncraving, but the whole structure of desire, of longing, hoping, in which there is \nalways the fear of frustration? The more I am frustrated, the more strength I give \nto the ‘me’. So long as there is hoping, longing, there is always the background \nof fear, which again strengthens that centre. And revolution is possible only at \nthat centre, not on the surface, which is merely a process of distraction, a \nsuperficial change leading to mischievous action. \nWhen I am aware of this whole structure of desire, I see how my mind has \nbecome a dead centre, a mechanical process of memory.

Being bored \nwith a particular sensation, I seek a new sensation, which may be what I call the \nrealization of God; but it is still sensation. I have had enough of this world and its \ntravail and I want peace, the peace that is everlasting; so I meditate, control, I \nshape my mind in order to experience that peace. The experiencing of that peace \nis still sensation. So my mind is the mechanical instrument of sensation, of \nmemory, a dead centre from which I act, think. The objects I pursue are the \nprojections of the mind as symbols from which it derives sensations. The word \n‘God’, the word ‘love’, the word ‘communism’, the word ‘democracy’, the word \n‘nationalism’—these are all symbols which give sensations to the mind, and \ntherefore the mind clings to them. As you and I know, every sensation comes to \nan end, and so we proceed from one sensation to another; and every sensation \nstrengthens the habit of seeking further sensation. Thus the mind becomes merely \nan instrument of sensation and memory, and in that process we are caught. So \nlong as the mind is seeking further experience it can only think in terms of \nsensation; and any experience that may be spontaneous, creative, vital, strikingly \nnew, it immediately reduces to sensation and pursues that sensation, which then \nbecomes a memory. Therefore the experience is dead and the mind becomes \nmerely a stagnant pool of the past. \nIf we have gone into it at all deeply we are familiar with this process; and we \nseem to be incapable of going beyond. We want to go beyond, because we are \ntired of this endless routine, this mechanical pursuit of sensation; so the mind \nprojects the idea of truth, of God; it dreams of a vital change and of playing a \nprincipal part in that change, and so on and on and on. Hence there is never a \ncreative state. In myself I see this process of desire going on, which is \nmechanical, repetitive, which holds the mind in a process of routine and makes of \nit a dead centre of the past in which there is no creative spontaneity. Also there \nare sudden moments of creation, of that which is not of the mind, which is not of \nmemory, which is not of sensation or of desire. \nOur problem, therefore, is to understand desire—not how far it should go or \nwhere it should come to an end, but to understand the whole process of desire, \nthe cravings, the longings, the burning appetites. Most of us think that possessing \nvery little indicates freedom from desire—and how we worship those who have \nbut few things! A loincloth, a robe, symbolizes our desire to be free from desire; \nbut that again is a very superficial reaction. Why begin at the superficial level of \ngiving up outward possessions when your mind is crippled with innumerable \nwants, innumerable desires, beliefs, struggles? Surely it is there that the \nrevolution must take place, not in how much you possess or what clothes you \nwear or how many meals you eat. But we are impressed by these things because \nour minds are very superficial. \nYour problem and my problem is to see whether the mind can ever be free \nfrom desire, from sensation. Surely creation has nothing to do with sensation; \nreality, God, or what you will, is not a state which can be experienced as \nsensation. When you have an experience, what happens? It has given you a \ncertain sensation, a feeling of elation or depression. Naturally, you try to avoid,"

    "text": "put aside, the state of depression; but if it is a joy, a feeling of elation, you pursue \nit. Your experience has produced a pleasurable sensation and you want more of \nit; and the ‘more’ strengthens the dead centre of the mind, which is ever craving \nfurther experience. Hence the mind cannot experience anything new, it is \nincapable of experiencing anything new, because its approach is always through \nmemory, through recognition; and that which is recognized through memory is \nnot truth, creation, reality. Such a mind cannot experience reality; it can only \nexperience sensation, and creation is not sensation, it is something that is \neverlastingly new from moment to moment. \nNow I realize the state of my own mind; I see that it is the instrument of \nsensation and desire, or rather that it is sensation and desire, and that it is \nmechanically caught up in routine. Such a mind is incapable of ever receiving or \nfeeling out the new; for the new must obviously be something beyond sensation, \nwhich is always the old. So, this mechanical process with its sensations has to \ncome to an end, has it not? The wanting more, the pursuit of symbols, words, \nimages, with their sensation—all that has to come to an end. Only then is it \npossible for the mind to be in that state of creativeness in which the new can \nalways come into being. If you will understand without being mesmerized by \nwords, by habits, by ideas, and see how important it is to have the new constantly \nimpinging on the mind, then, perhaps, you will understand the process of desire, \nthe routine, the boredom, the constant craving for experience. Then I think you \nwill begin to see that desire has very little significance in life for a man who is \nreally seeking. Obviously there are certain physical needs: food, clothing, shelter, \nand all the rest of it. But they never become psychological appetites, things on \nwhich the mind builds itself as a centre of desire. Beyond the physical needs, any \nform of desire—for greatness, for truth, for virtue—becomes a psychological \nprocess by which the mind builds the idea of the ‘me’ and strengthens itself at the \ncentre. \nWhen you see this process, when you are really aware of it without \nopposition, without a sense of temptation, without resistance, without justifying \nor judging it, then you will discover that the mind is capable of receiving the new \nand that the new is never a sensation; therefore it can never be recognized, re-\nexperienced. It is a state of being in which creativeness comes without invitation, \nwithout memory; and that is reality."

One cannot live in isolation, so life \nis relationship and relationship is action. And how can one have that capacity for \nunderstanding relationship which is life? Does not relationship mean not only \ncommunion with people but intimacy with things and ideas? Life is relationship, \nwhich is expressed through contact with things, with people and with ideas. In \nunderstanding relationship we shall have capacity to meet life fully, adequately. \nSo our problem is not capacity—for capacity is not independent of relationship—\nbut rather the understanding of relationship, which will naturally produce the \ncapacity for quick pliability, for quick adjustment, for quick response. \nRelationship, surely, is the mirror in which you discover yourself. Without \nrelationship you are not; to be is to be related; to be related is existence. You \nexist only in relationship; otherwise you do not exist, existence has no meaning. \nIt is not because you think you are that you come into existence. You exist \nbecause you are related; and it is the lack of understanding of relationship that \ncauses conflict. \nNow there is no understanding of relationship, because we use relationship \nmerely as a means of furthering achievement, furthering transformation, \nfurthering becoming. But relationship is a means of self-discovery, because \nrelationship is to be; it is existence. Without relationship, I am not. To understand \nmyself, I must understand relationship. Relationship is a mirror in which I can \nsee myself. That mirror can either be distorted, or it can be ‘as is’, reflecting that \nwhich is. But most of us see in relationship, in that mirror, things we would \nrather see; we do not see what is. We would rather idealize, escape, we would \nrather live in the future than understand that relationship in the immediate \npresent. \nNow if we examine our life, our relationship with another, we shall see that it \nis a process of isolation. We are really not concerned with another; though we \ntalk a great deal about it, actually we are not concerned. We are related to \nsomeone only so long as that relationship gratifies us, so long as it gives us a \nrefuge, so long as it satisfies us. But the moment there is a disturbance in the \nrelationship which produces discomfort in ourselves, we discard that relationship. \nIn other words, there is relationship only so long as we are gratified. This may \nsound harsh, but if you really examine your life very closely you will see it is a \nfact; and to avoid a fact is to live in ignorance, which can never produce right \nrelationship. If we look into our lives and observe relationship, we see it is a \nprocess of building resistance against another, a wall over which we look and \nobserve the other; but we always retain the wall and remain behind it, whether it \nbe a psychological wall, a material wall, an economic wall or a national wall. So \nlong as we live in isolation, behind a wall, there is no relationship with another; \nand we live enclosed because it is much more gratifying, we think it is much \nmore secure. The world is so disruptive, there is so much sorrow, so much pain, \nwar, destruction, misery, that we want to escape and live within the walls of \nsecurity of our own psychological being.

That is exactly what is happening throughout the world: \nyou remain in your isolation and stretch your hand over the wall, calling it \nnationalism, brotherhood or what you will, but actually sovereign governments, \narmies, continue. Still clinging to your own limitations, you think you can create \nworld unity, world peace—which is impossible. So long as you have a frontier, \nwhether national, economic, religious or social, it is an obvious fact that there \ncannot be peace in the world. \nThe process of isolation is a process of the search for power; whether one is \nseeking power individually or for a racial or national group there must be \nisolation, because the very desire for power, for position, is separatism. After all, \nthat is what each one wants, is it not? He wants a powerful position in which he \ncan dominate, whether at home, in the office, or in a bureaucratic régime. Each \none is seeking power, and in seeking power he will establish a society which is \nbased on power, military, industrial, economic, and so on—which again is \nobvious. Is not the desire for power in its very nature isolating? I think it is very \nimportant to understand this, because the man who wants a peaceful world, a \nworld in which there are no wars, no appalling destruction, no catastrophic \nmisery on an immeasurable scale, must understand this fundamental question, \nmust he not? A man who is affectionate, who is kindly, has no sense of power, \nand therefore such a man is not bound to any nationality, to any flag. He has no \nflag. \nThere is no such thing as living in isolation—no country, no people, no \nindividual, can live in isolation; yet, because you are seeking power in so many \ndifferent ways, you breed isolation. The nationalist is a curse because through his \nvery nationalistic, patriotic spirit, he is creating a wall of isolation. He is so \nidentified with his country that he builds a wall against another. What happens \nwhen you build a wall against something? That something is constantly beating \nagainst your wall. When you resist something, the very resistance indicates that \nyou are in conflict with the other. So nationalism, which is a process of isolation, \nwhich is the outcome of the search for power, cannot bring about peace in the \nworld. The man who is a nationalist and talks of brotherhood is telling a lie; he is \nliving in a state of contradiction. \nCan one live in the world without the desire for power, for position, for \nauthority? Obviously one can. One does it when one does not identify oneself \nwith something greater. This identification with something greater—the party, \nthe country, the race, the religion, God—is the search for power. Because you in \nyourself are empty, dull, weak, you like to identify yourself with something \ngreater. That desire to identify yourself with something greater is the desire for \npower. \nRelationship is a process of self-revelation, and, without knowing oneself, the \nways of one’s own mind and heart, merely to establish an outward order, a \nsystem, a cunning formula, has very little meaning.

Is that not a wrong \nprocess and is that not a pursuit which does not bring about the creative state? If \nit is a wrong process, can we wipe it out completely and put it aside? That can \ncome about only when I experience, not as a thinker experiences, but when I am \naware of the false process and see that there is only a state in which the thinker is \nthe thought. \nSo long as I am experiencing, so long as I am becoming, there must be this \ndualistic action; there must be the thinker and the thought, two separate processes \nat work; there is no integration, there is always a centre which is operating \nthrough the will of action to be or not to be—collectively, individually, \nnationally and so on. Universally, this is the process. So long as effort is divided \ninto the experiencer and the experience, there must be deterioration. Integration \nis only possible when the thinker is no longer the observer. That is, we know at \npresent there are the thinker and the thought, the observer and the observed, the \nexperiencer and the experienced; there are two different states. Our effort is to \nbridge the two. \nThe will of action is always dualistic. Is it possible to go beyond this will \nwhich is separative and discover a state in which this dualistic action is not? That \ncan only be found when we directly experience the state in which the thinker is \nthe thought. We now think the thought is separate from the thinker; but is that \nso? We would like to think it is, because then the thinker can explain matters \nthrough his thought. The effort of the thinker is to become more or become less; \nand therefore, in that struggle, in that action of the will, in ‘becoming’, there is \nalways the deteriorating factor; we are pursuing a false process and not a true \nprocess. \nIs there a division between the thinker and the thought? So long as they are \nseparate, divided, our effort is wasted; we are pursuing a false process which is \ndestructive and which is the deteriorating factor. We think the thinker is separate \nfrom his thought. When I find that I am greedy, possessive, brutal, I think I \nshould not be all this. The thinker then tries to alter his thoughts and therefore \neffort is made to ‘become’; in that process of effort he pursues the false illusion \nthat there are two separate processes, whereas there is only one process. I think \ntherein lies the fundamental factor of deterioration. \nIs it possible to experience that state when there is only one entity and not two \nseparate processes, the experiencer and the experience? Then perhaps we shall \nfind out what it is to be creative, and what the state is in which there is no \ndeterioration at any time, in whatever relationship man may be. \nI am greedy. I and greed are not two different states; there is only one thing \nand that is greed. If I am aware that I am greedy, what happens? I make an effort \nnot to be greedy, either for sociological reasons or for religious reasons; that \neffort will always be in a small limited circle; I may extend the circle but it is \nalways limited. Therefore the deteriorating factor is there. But when I look a little"

Unfortunately, we don’t think along those lines. There is the ‘me’, \nthe superior entity, the soldier who is controlling, dominating. To me that process \nis destructive. It is an illusion and we know why we do it. I divide myself into the \nhigh and the low in order to continue. If there is only greed, completely, not ‘I’ \noperating greed, but I am entirely greed, then what happens? Surely then there is \na different process at work altogether, a different problem comes into being. It is \nthat problem which is creative, in which there is no sense of ‘I’ dominating, \nbecoming, positively or negatively. We must come to that state if we would be \ncreative. In that state, there is no maker of effort. It is not a matter of verbalizing \nor of trying to find out what that state is; if you set about it in that way you will \nlose and you will never find. What is important is to see that the maker of effort \nand the object towards which he is making effort are the same.

We have \nrelied on the intellect to show us the way out of our complexity. The more \ncunning, the more hideous, the more subtle the intellect is, the greater the variety \nof systems, of theories, of ideas. And ideas do not solve any of our human \nproblems; they never have and they never will. The mind is not the solution; the \nway of thought is obviously not the way out of our difficulty. It seems to me that \nwe should first understand this process of thinking, and perhaps be able to go \nbeyond—for when thought ceases, perhaps we shall be able to find a way which \nwill help us to solve our problems, not only the individual but also the collective. \nThinking has not solved our problems. The clever ones, the philosophers, the \nscholars, the political leaders, have not really solved any of our human \nproblems—which are the relationship between you and another, between you and \nmyself. So far we have used the mind, the intellect, to help us investigate the \nproblem and thereby are hoping to find a solution. Can thought ever dissolve our \nproblems? Is not thought, unless it is in the laboratory or on the drawing board, \nalways self-protecting, self-perpetuating, conditioned? Is not its activity self-\ncentred? And can such thought ever resolve any of the problems which thought \nitself has created? Can the mind, which has created the problems, resolve those \nthings that it has itself brought forth? \nSurely thinking is a reaction. If I ask you a question, you respond to it—you \nrespond according to your memory, to your prejudices, to your upbringing, to the \nclimate, to the whole background of your conditioning; you reply accordingly, \nyou think accordingly. The centre of this background is the ‘me’ in the process of \naction. So long as that background is not understood, so long as that thought \nprocess, that self which creates the problem, is not understood and put an end to, \nwe are bound to have conflict, within and without, in thought, in emotion, in \naction. No solution of any kind, however clever, however well thought out, can \never put an end to the conflict between man and man, between you and me. \nRealizing this, being aware of how thought springs up and from what source, \nthen we ask, “Can thought ever come to an end?” \nThat is one of the problems, is it not? Can thought resolve our problems? By \nthinking over the problem, have you resolved it? Any kind of problem—\neconomic, social, religious—has it ever been really solved by thinking? In your \ndaily life, the more you think about a problem, the more complex, the more \nirresolute, the more uncertain it becomes. Is that not so?—in our actual, daily \nlife? You may, in thinking out certain facets of the problem, see more clearly \nanother person’s point of view, but thought cannot see the completeness and \nfullness of the problem—it can only see partially and a partial answer is not a \ncomplete answer, therefore it is not a solution. \nThe more we think over a problem, the more we investigate, analyse and \ndiscuss it, the more complex it becomes. So is it possible to look at the problem \ncomprehensively, wholly? How is this possible? Because that, it seems to me, is \nour major difficulty. Our problems are being multiplied—there is imminent"

Surely it is only possible when the process of \nthinking—which has its source in the ‘me’, the self, in the background of \ntradition, of conditioning, of prejudice, of hope, of despair—has come to an end. \nCan we understand this self, not by analysing, but by seeing the thing as it is, \nbeing aware of it as a fact and not as a theory?—not seeking to dissolve the self \nin order to achieve a result but seeing the activity of the self, the ‘me’, constantly \nin action? Can we look at it, without any movement to destroy or to encourage? \nThat is the problem, is it not? If, in each one of us, the centre of the ‘me’ is non-\nexistent, with its desire for power, position, authority, continuance, self-\npreservation, surely our problems will come to an end! \nThe self is a problem that thought cannot resolve. There must be an \nawareness which is not of thought. To be aware, without condemnation or \njustification, of the activities of the self—just to be aware—is sufficient. If you \nare aware in order to find out how to resolve the problem, in order to transform it, \nin order to produce a result, then it is still within the field of the self, of the ‘me’. \nSo long as we are seeking a result, whether through analysis, through awareness, \nthrough constant examination of every thought, we are still within the field of \nthought, which is within the field of the ‘me’, of the ‘I’, of the ego, or what you \nwill. \nAs long as the activity of the mind exists, surely there can be no love. When \nthere is love, we shall have no social problems. But love is not something to be \nacquired. The mind can seek to acquire it, like a new thought, a new gadget, a \nnew way of thinking; but the mind cannot be in a state of love so long as thought \nis acquiring love. So long as the mind is seeking to be in a state of non-greed, \nsurely it is still greedy, is it not? Similarly, so long as the mind wishes, desires, \nand practises in order to be in a state in which there is love, surely it denies that \nstate, does it not? \nSeeing this problem, this complex problem of living, and being aware of the \nprocess of our own thinking and realizing that it actually leads nowhere—when \nwe deeply realize that, then surely there is a state of intelligence which is not \nindividual or collective. Then the problem of the relationship of the individual to \nsociety, of the individual to the community, of the individual to reality, ceases; \nbecause then there is only intelligence, which is neither personal nor impersonal. \nIt is this intelligence alone, I feel, that can solve our immense problems. That \ncannot be a result; it comes into being only when we understand this whole total \nprocess of thinking, not only at the conscious level but also at the deeper, hidden \nlevels of consciousness. \nTo understand any of these problems we have to have a very quiet mind, a \nvery still mind, so that the mind can look at the problem without interposing \nideas or theories, without any distraction. That is one of our difficulties—because \nthought has become a distraction. When I want to understand, look at something, \nI don’t have to think about it—I look at it.

That is the only way you can investigate. Do not \nsuperimpose what it should do, how it should think or act and so on; that would \namount to making mere statements. That is if you say the mind should be this or \nshould not be that, then you stop all investigation and all thinking; or, if you \nquote some high authority, then you equally stop thinking, don’t you? If you \nquote Buddha, Christ or XYZ, there is an end to all pursuit, to all thinking and all \ninvestigation. So one has to guard against that. You must put aside all these \nsubtleties of the mind if you would investigate this problem of the self together \nwith me. \nWhat is the function of the mind? To find that out, you must know what the \nmind is actually doing. What does your mind do? It is all a process of thinking, is \nit not? Otherwise, the mind is not there. So long as the mind is not thinking, \nconsciously or unconsciously, there is no consciousness. We have to find out \nwhat the mind that we use in our everyday life, and also the mind of which most \nof us are unconscious, does in relation to our problems. We must look at the \nmind as it is and not as it should be. \nNow what is mind as it is functioning? It is actually a process of isolation, is \nit not? Fundamentally that is what the process of thought is. It is thinking in an \nisolated form, yet remaining collective. When you observe your own thinking, \nyou will see it is an isolated, fragmentary process. You are thinking according to \nyour reactions, the reactions of your memory, of your experience, of your \nknowledge, of your belief. You are reacting to all that, aren’t you? If I say that \nthere must be a fundamental revolution, you immediately react. You will object \nto that word ‘revolution’ if you have got good investments, spiritual or otherwise. \nSo your reaction is dependent on your knowledge, on your belief, on your \nexperience. That is an obvious fact. There are various forms of reaction. You say \n“I must be brotherly”, “I must cooperate”, “I must be friendly”, “I must be kind”, \nand so on. What are these? These are all reactions; but the fundamental reaction \nof thinking is a process of isolation. You are watching the process of your own \nmind, each one of you, which means watching your own action, belief, \nknowledge, experience. All these give security, do they not? They give security, \ngive strength to the process of thinking. That process only strengthens the ‘me’, \nthe mind, the self—whether you call that self high or low. All our religions, all \nour social sanctions, all our laws are for the support of the individual, the \nindividual self, the separative action; and in opposition to that there is the \ntotalitarian state. If you go deeper into the unconscious, there too it is the same \nprocess that is at work. There, we are the collective influenced by the \nenvironment, by the climate, by the society, by the father, the mother, the \ngrandfather. There again is the desire to assert, to dominate as an individual, as \nthe ‘me’."

Is it possible for the mind not to think separatively, in a self-\nenclosed manner, fragmentarily? That is impossible. So we worship the mind; the \nmind is extraordinarily important. Don’t you know, the moment you are a little \nbit cunning, a little bit alert, and have a little accumulated information and \nknowledge, how important you become in society? You know how you worship \nthose who are intellectually superior, the lawyers, the professors, the orators, the \ngreat writers, the explainers and the expounders! You have cultivated the \nintellect and the mind. \nThe function of the mind is to be separated; otherwise your mind is not there. \nHaving cultivated this process for centuries we find we cannot cooperate; we can \nonly be urged, compelled, driven by authority, fear, either economic or religious. \nIf that is the actual state, not only consciously but also at the deeper levels, in our \nmotives, our intentions, our pursuits, how can there be cooperation? How can \nthere be intelligent coming together to do something? As that is almost \nimpossible, religions and organized social parties force the individual to certain \nforms of discipline. Discipline then becomes imperative if we want to come \ntogether, to do things together. \nUntil we understand how to transcend this separative thinking, this process of \ngiving emphasis to the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’, whether in the collective form or in \nindividual form, we shall not have peace; we shall have constant conflict and \nwars. Our problem is how to bring an end to the separative process of thought. \nCan thought ever destroy the self, thought being the process of verbalization and \nof reaction? Thought is nothing else but reaction; thought is not creative. Can \nsuch thought put an end to itself? That is what we are trying to find out. When I \nthink along these lines: “I must discipline”, “I must think more properly”, “I must \nbe this or that”, thought is compelling itself, urging itself, disciplining itself to be \nsomething or not to be something. Is that not a process of isolation? It is \ntherefore not that integrated intelligence which functions as a whole, from which \nalone there can be cooperation. \nHow are you to come to the end of thought?

Obviously, you have not succeeded all \nthese long years, otherwise you would not be here. Please examine the \ndisciplining process, which is solely a thought process, in which there is \nsubjection, repression, control, domination—all affecting the unconscious, which \nasserts itself later as you grow older. Having tried for such a long time to no \npurpose, you must have found that discipline is obviously not the process to \ndestroy the self. The self cannot be destroyed through discipline, because \ndiscipline is a process of strengthening the self. Yet all your religions support it; \nall your meditations, your assertions are based on this. Will knowledge destroy \nthe self? Will belief destroy it?

You understand that any reaction is conditioned and that, through \nconditioning, there can be no freedom either at the beginning or at the end—and \nfreedom is always at the beginning and not at the end. \nWhen you realize that any reaction is a form of conditioning and therefore \ngives continuity to the self in different ways, what actually takes place? You \nmust be very clear in this matter. Belief, knowledge, discipline, experience, the \nwhole process of achieving a result or an end, ambition, becoming something in \nthis life or in a future life—all these are a process of isolation, a process which \nbrings destruction, misery, wars, from which there is no escape through \ncollective action, however much you may be threatened with concentration \ncamps and all the rest of it.

That is a very \nserious matter, especially in a crisis of the kind which the world is facing. But in \norder to understand this whole problem of self-deception we must follow it not \nmerely at the verbal level but intrinsically, fundamentally, deeply. We are too \neasily satisfied with words and counter-words; we are worldly-wise; and, being \nworldly-wise, all that we can do is to hope that something will happen. We see \nthat the explanation of war does not stop war; there are innumerable historians, \ntheologians and religious people explaining war and how it comes into being but \nwars still go on, perhaps more destructive than ever. Those of us who are really \nearnest must go beyond the word, must seek this fundamental revolution within \nourselves. That is the only remedy which can bring about a lasting, fundamental \nredemption of mankind. \nSimilarly, when we are discussing this kind of self-deception, I think we \nshould guard against any superficial explanations and rejoinders; we should, if I \nmay suggest it, not merely listen to a speaker but follow the problem as we know \nit in our daily life; that is we should watch ourselves in thinking and in action, \nwatch how we affect others and how we proceed to act from ourselves. \nWhat is the reason, the basis, for self-deception? How many of us are actually \naware that we are deceiving ourselves? Before we can answer the question “What \nis self-deception and how does it arise?”, must we not be aware that we are \ndeceiving ourselves? Do we know that we are deceiving ourselves? What do we \nmean by this deception? I think it is very important, because the more we deceive \nourselves the greater is the strength in the deception; for it gives us a certain \nvitality, a certain energy, a certain capacity which entails the imposing of our \ndeception on others. So gradually we are not only imposing deception on \nourselves but on others. It is an interacting process of self-deception. Are we \naware of this process? We think we are capable of thinking very clearly, \npurposefully and directly; and are we aware that, in this process of thinking, there \nis self-deception? \nIs not thought itself a process of search, a seeking of justification, of security, \nof self-protection, a desire to be well thought of, a desire to have position, \nprestige and power? Is not this desire to be, politically, or religio-sociologically, \nthe very cause of self-deception? The moment I want something other than the \npurely materialistic necessities, do I not produce, do I not bring about, a state \nwhich easily accepts? Take, for example, this: many of us are interested to know \nwhat happens after death; the older we are, the more interested we are. We want \nto know the truth of it. How shall we find it? Certainly not by reading nor \nthrough the different explanations. \nHow will you find it out? First, you must purge your mind completely of \nevery factor that is in the way—every hope, every desire to continue, every \ndesire to find out what is on that other side.

What is important is not whether reincarnation is true or not but \nhow the mind seeks justification, through self-deception, of a fact which may or \nmay not be. What is important is the approach to the problem, with what \nmotivation, with what urge, with what desire you come to it. \nThe seeker is always imposing this deception upon himself; no one can \nimpose it upon him; he himself does it. We create deception and then we become \nslaves to it. The fundamental factor of self-deception is this constant desire to be \nsomething in this world and in the world hereafter. We know the result of \nwanting to be something in this world; it is utter confusion, where each is \ncompeting with the other, each is destroying the other in the name of peace; you \nknow the whole game we play with each other, which is an extraordinary form of \nself-deception. Similarly, we want security in the other world, a position. \nSo we begin to deceive ourselves the moment there is this urge to be, to \nbecome or to achieve. That is a very difficult thing for the mind to be free from. \nThat is one of the basic problems of our life. Is it possible to live in this world \nand be nothing? Then only is there freedom from all deception, because then \nonly is the mind not seeking a result, the mind is not seeking a satisfactory \nanswer, the mind is not seeking any form of justification, the mind is not seeking \nsecurity in any form, in any relationship. That takes place only when the mind \nrealizes the possibilities and subtleties of deception and therefore, with \nunderstanding, abandons every form of justification, security—which means the \nmind is capable, then, of being completely nothing. Is that possible? \nSo long as we deceive ourselves in any form, there can be no love. So long as \nthe mind is capable of creating and imposing upon itself a delusion, it obviously \nseparates itself from collective or integrated understanding. That is one of our \ndifficulties; we do not know how to cooperate. All that we know is that we try to \nwork together towards an end which both of us bring into being.

Surely that is true \ncooperation, is it not? If you and I think out, work out, plan out a result and we \nare working together towards that result, then what is the process involved? Our \nthoughts, our intellectual minds, are of course meeting; but emotionally, the \nwhole being may be resisting it, which brings about deception, which brings \nabout conflict between you and me. It is an obvious and observable fact in our \neveryday life. You and I agree to do a certain piece of work intellectually but \nunconsciously, deeply, you and I are at battle with each other.

Surely this process of thinking is \nvery superficial, because through identification we bring about separation—\nwhich is so obvious in our everyday life. You are a Hindu and I a Catholic; we \nboth preach brotherhood, and we are at each other’s throats. Why? That is one of \nour problems, is it not? Unconsciously and deeply, you have your beliefs and I \nhave mine. By talking about brotherhood, we have not solved the whole problem \nof beliefs but have only theoretically and intellectually agreed that this should be \nso; inwardly and deeply, we are against each other. \nUntil we dissolve those barriers which are a self-deception, which give us a \ncertain vitality, there can be no cooperation between you and me. Through \nidentification with a group, with a particular idea, with a particular country, we \ncan never bring about cooperation. \nBelief does not bring about cooperation; on the contrary, it divides. We see \nhow one political party is against another, each believing in a certain way of \ndealing with economic problems, and so they are all at war with one another. \nThey are not resolved in solving, for instance, the problem of starvation. They \nare concerned with the theories which are going to solve that problem. They are \nnot actually concerned with the problem itself but with the method by which the \nproblem will be solved. Therefore there must be contention between the two, \nbecause they are concerned with the idea and not with the problem. Similarly, \nreligious people are against each other, though verbally they say they have all \none life, one God; you know all that. Inwardly their beliefs, their opinions, their \nexperiences are destroying them and are keeping them separate. \nExperience becomes a dividing factor in our human relationship; experience \nis a way of deception. If I have experienced something, I cling to it, I do not go \ninto the whole problem of the process of experiencing but, because I have \nexperienced, that is sufficient and I cling to it; thereby I impose, through that \nexperience, self-deception. \nOur difficulty is that each of us is so identified with a particular belief, with a \nparticular form or method of bringing about happiness, economic adjustment, \nthat our mind is captured by that and we are incapable of going deeper into the \nproblem; therefore we desire to remain aloof individually in our particular ways, \nbeliefs and experiences. Until we dissolve them, through understanding—not \nonly at the superficial level, but at the deeper level also—there can be no peace \nin the world. That is why it is important for those who are really serious, to \nunderstand this whole problem—the desire to become, to achieve, to gain—not \nonly at the superficial level but fundamentally and deeply; otherwise there can be \nno peace in the world."

Religions, \nthrough promises, through fear of hell, through every form of condemnation, \nhave tried in different ways to dissuade man from this constant activity that is \nborn from the centre of the ‘me’. These having failed, political organizations \nhave taken over. There again, persuasion; there again the ultimate utopian hope. \nEvery form of legislation from the very limited to the extreme, including \nconcentration camps, has been used and enforced against any form of resistance. \nYet we go on in our self-centred activity, which is the only kind of action we \nseem to know. If we think about it at all, we try to modify; if we are aware of it, \nwe try to change the course of it; but fundamentally, deeply, there is no \ntransformation, there is no radical cessation of that activity. The thoughtful are \naware of this; they are also aware that when that activity from the centre ceases, \nonly then can there be happiness. Most of us take it for granted that self-centred \nactivity is natural and that the consequential action, which is inevitable, can only \nbe modified, shaped and controlled. Now those who are a little more serious, \nmore earnest, not sincere—because sincerity is the way of self-deception—must \nfind out whether, being aware of this extraordinary total process of self-centred \nactivity, one can go beyond. \nTo understand what this self-centred activity is, one must obviously examine \nit, look at it, be aware of the entire process. If one can be aware of it, then there is \nthe possibility of its dissolution; but to be aware of it requires a certain \nunderstanding, a certain intention to face the thing as it is and not to interpret, not \nto modify, not to condemn it. We have to be aware of what we are doing, of all \nthe activity which springs from that self-centred state; we must be conscious of \nit. One of our primary difficulties is that the moment we are conscious of that \nactivity, we want to shape it, we want to control it, we want to condemn it or we \nwant to modify it, so we are seldom able to look at it directly. When we do, very \nfew of us are capable of knowing what to do. \nWe realize that self-centred activities are detrimental, are destructive, and that \nevery form of identification—such as with a country, with a particular group, \nwith a particular desire, the search for a result here or hereafter, the glorification \nof an idea, the pursuit of an example, the pursuit of virtue and so on—is \nessentially the activity of a self-centred person. All our relationships, with nature, \nwith people, with ideas, are the outcome of that activity. Knowing all this, what \nis one to do? All such activity must voluntarily come to an end—not self-\nimposed, not influenced, not guided. \nMost of us are aware that this self-centred activity creates mischief and chaos \nbut we are only aware of it in certain directions. Either we observe it in others \nand are ignorant of our own activities or being aware, in relationship with others, \nof our own self-centred activity we want to transform, we want to find a \nsubstitute, we want to go beyond. Before we can deal with it we must know how \nthis process comes into being, must we not? In order to understand something,"

Or I am conscious of that centre when pleasure comes to an end and I want \nto have more of it; then there is resistance and a purposive shaping of the mind to \na particular end which will give me a delight, a satisfaction; I am aware of myself \nand my activities when I am pursuing virtue consciously. Surely a man who \npursues virtue consciously is unvirtuous. Humility cannot be pursued, and that is \nthe beauty of humility. \nThis self-centred process is the result of time, is it not? So long as this centre \nof activity exists in any direction, conscious or unconscious, there is the \nmovement of time and I am conscious of the past and the present in conjunction \nwith the future. The self-centred activity of the ‘me’ is a time process. It is \nmemory that gives continuity to the activity of the centre, which is the ‘me’. If \nyou watch yourself and are aware of this centre of activity, you will see that it is \nonly the process of time, of memory, of experiencing and translating every \nexperience according to a memory; you will also see that self-activity is \nrecognition, which is also the process of the mind. \nCan the mind be free from all this? It may be possible at rare moments; it may \nhappen to most of us when we do an unconscious, unintentional, unpurposive \nact; but is it possible for the mind ever to be completely free from self-centred \nactivity? That is a very important question to put to ourselves, because in the \nvery putting of it, you will find the answer. If you are aware of the total process \nof this self-centred activity, fully cognizant of its activities at different levels of \nyour consciousness, then surely you have to ask yourselves if it is possible for \nthat activity to come to an end. Is it possible not to think in terms of time, not to \nthink in terms of what I shall be, what I have been, what I am? For from such \nthought the whole process of self-centred activity begins; there, also, begins the \ndetermination to become, the determination to choose and to avoid, which are all \na process of time. We see in that process infinite mischief, misery, confusion, \ndistortion, deterioration. \nSurely the process of time is not revolutionary. In the process of time there is \nno transformation; there is only a continuity and no ending, there is nothing but \nrecognition. It is only when you have complete cessation of the time process, of \nthe activity of the self, that there is a revolution, a transformation, the coming \ninto being of the new. \nBeing aware of this whole total process of the ‘me’ in its activity, what is the \nmind to do? It is only with renewal, it is only with revolution—not through \nevolution, not through the ‘me’ becoming, but through the ‘me’ completely \ncoming to an end—that there is the new. The time process cannot bring the new; \ntime is not the way of creation. \nI do not know if any of you have had a moment of creativity.

If we are aware, we shall see \nthat in that state there is no experiencer who remembers, translates, recognizes \nand then identifies; there is no thought process, which is of time. In that state of \ncreation, of creativity of the new, which is timeless, there is no action of the ‘me’ \nat all. \nOur question surely is: Is it possible for the mind to be in that state, not \nmomentarily, not at rare moments, but—I would rather not use the words \n‘everlasting’ or ‘for ever’, because that would imply time—but to be in that state \nwithout regard to time? Surely that is an important discovery to be made by each \none of us, because that is the door to love; all other doors are activities of the self. \nWhere there is action of the self, there is no love. Love is not of time. You cannot \npractise love. If you do, then it is a self-conscious activity of the ‘me’ which \nhopes through loving to gain a result. \nLove is not of time; you cannot come upon it through any conscious effort, \nthrough any discipline, through identification, which is all of the process of time. \nThe mind, knowing only the process of time, cannot recognize love. Love is the \nonly thing that is eternally new. Since most of us have cultivated the mind, which \nis the result of time, we do not know what love is. We talk about love; we say we \nlove people, that we love our children, our wife, our neighbour, that we love \nnature; but the moment we are conscious that we love, self-activity has come into \nbeing; therefore it ceases to be love. \nThis total process of the mind is to be understood only through relationship—\nrelationship with nature, with people, with our own projections, with everything \nabout us. Life is nothing but relationship. Though we may attempt to isolate \nourselves from relationship, we cannot exist without it. Though relationship is \npainful we cannot run away, by means of isolation, by becoming a hermit and so \non. All these methods are indications of the activity of the self. Seeing this whole \npicture, being aware of the whole process of time as consciousness, without any \nchoice, without any determined, purposive intention, without the desire for any \nresult, you will see that this process of time comes to an end voluntarily—not \ninduced, not as a result of desire. It is only when that process comes to an end \nthat love is, which is eternally new. \nWe do not have to seek truth. Truth is not something far away. It is the truth \nabout the mind, truth about its activities from moment to moment. If we are \naware of this moment-to-moment truth, of this whole process of time, that \nawareness releases consciousness or the energy which is intelligence, love. So \nlong as the mind uses consciousness as self-activity, time comes into being with \nall its miseries, with all its conflicts, with all its mischief, its purposive \ndeceptions; and it is only when the mind, understanding this total process, ceases, \nthat love can be."

After all, we \nare seeking, each in his own way, a sense of happiness, of enrichment. Surely a \nlife that has significance, the riches of true happiness, is not of time. Like love, \nsuch a life is timeless; and to understand that which is timeless, we must not \napproach it through time but rather understand time. We must not utilize time as \na means of attaining, realizing, apprehending the timeless. That is what we are \ndoing most of our lives: spending time in trying to grasp that which is timeless, \nso it is important to understand what we mean by time, because I think it is \npossible to be free of time. It is very important to understand time as a whole and \nnot partially. \nIt is interesting to realize that our lives are mostly spent in time—time, not in \nthe sense of chronological sequence, of minutes, hours, days and years, but in the \nsense of psychological memory. We live by time, we are the result of time. Our \nminds are the product of many yesterdays and the present is merely the passage \nof the past to the future. Our minds, our activities, our being, are founded on \ntime; without time we cannot think, because thought is the result of time, thought \nis the product of many yesterdays and there is no thought without memory. \nMemory is time; for there are two kinds of time, the chronological and the \npsychological. There is time as yesterday by the watch and as yesterday by \nmemory. You cannot reject chronological time; it would be absurd—you would \nmiss your train. But is there really any time at all apart from chronological time? \nObviously there is time as yesterday but is there time as the mind thinks of it? Is \nthere time apart from the mind? Surely time, psychological time, is the product of \nthe mind. Without the foundation of thought there is no time—time merely being \nmemory as yesterday in conjunction with today, which moulds tomorrow. That \nis, memory of yesterday’s experience in response to the present is creating the \nfuture—which is still the process of thought, a path of the mind. The thought \nprocess brings about psychological progress in time but is it real, as real as \nchronological time? And can we use that time which is of the mind as a means of \nunderstanding the eternal, the timeless? As I said, happiness is not of yesterday, \nhappiness is not the product of time, happiness is always in the present, a \ntimeless state. I do not know if you have noticed that when you have ecstasy, a \ncreative joy, a series of bright clouds surrounded by dark clouds, in that moment \nthere is no time: there is only the immediate present. The mind, coming in after \nthe experiencing in the present, remembers and wishes to continue it, gathering \nmore and more of itself, thereby creating time. So time is created by the ‘more’; \ntime is acquisition and time is also detachment, which is still an acquisition of the \nmind. Therefore merely disciplining the mind in time, conditioning thought \nwithin the framework of time, which is memory, surely does not reveal that \nwhich is timeless."

    "text": "Is transformation a matter of time? Most of us are accustomed to think that \ntime is necessary for transformation: I am something, and to change what I am \ninto what I should be requires time. I am greedy, with greed’s results of \nconfusion, antagonism, conflict, and misery; to bring about the transformation, \nwhich is non-greed, we think time is necessary. That is to say time is considered \nas a means of evolving something greater, of becoming something. The problem \nis this: One is violent, greedy, envious, angry, vicious or passionate. To \ntransform what is, is time necessary? First of all, why do we want to change what \nis, or bring about a transformation? Why? Because what we are dissatisfies us; it \ncreates conflict, disturbance, and, disliking that state, we want something better, \nsomething nobler, more idealistic. Therefore we desire transformation because \nthere is pain, discomfort, conflict. Is conflict overcome by time? If you say it will \nbe overcome by time, you are still in conflict. You may say it will take twenty \ndays or twenty years to get rid of conflict, to change what you are, but during that \ntime you are still in conflict and therefore time does not bring about \ntransformation. When we use time as a means of acquiring a quality, a virtue or a \nstate of being, we are merely postponing or avoiding what is; and I think it is \nimportant to understand this point. Greed or violence causes pain, disturbance in \nthe world of our relationship with another, which is society; and being conscious \nof this state of disturbance, which we term greed or violence, we say to \nourselves, “I will get out of it in time. I will practise non-violence, I will practise \nnon-envy, I will practise peace.” Now, you want to practise non-violence because \nviolence is a state of disturbance, conflict, and you think that in time you will \ngain non-violence and overcome the conflict. What is actually happening? Being \nin a state of conflict you want to achieve a state in which there is no conflict. \nNow is that state of no conflict the result of time, of a duration? Obviously not; \nbecause, while you are achieving a state of non-violence, you are still being \nviolent and are therefore still in conflict. \nOur problem is, can a conflict, a disturbance, be overcome in a period of time, \nwhether it be days, years or lives? What happens when you say, “I am going to \npractise non-violence during a certain period of time”? The very practice \nindicates that you are in conflict, does it not? You would not practise if you were \nnot resisting conflict; you say the resistance to conflict is necessary in order to \novercome conflict and for that resistance you must have time. But the very \nresistance to conflict is itself a form of conflict. You are spending your energy in \nresisting conflict in the form of what you call greed, envy or violence but your \nmind is still in conflict, so it is important to see the falseness of the process of \ndepending on time as a means of overcoming violence and thereby be free of that \nprocess. Then you are able to be what you are: a psychological disturbance which \nis violence itself. \nTo understand anything, any human or scientific problem, what is important, \nwhat is essential? A quiet mind, is it not?, a mind that is intent on understanding. \nIt is not a mind that is exclusive, that is trying to concentrate—which again is an \neffort of resistance. If I really want to understand something, there is \nimmediately a quiet state of mind. When you want to listen to music or look at a \npicture which you love, which you have a feeling for, what is the state of your"

Similarly, \nwhen you want to understand conflict, you are no longer depending on time at \nall; you are simply confronted with what is, which is conflict. Then immediately \nthere comes a quietness, a stillness of mind. When you no longer depend on time \nas a means of transforming what is because you see the falseness of that process, \nthen you are confronted with what is, and as you are interested to understand \nwhat is, naturally you have a quiet mind. In that alert yet passive state of mind \nthere is understanding. So long as the mind is in conflict, blaming, resisting, \ncondemning, there can be no understanding. If I want to understand you, I must \nnot condemn you, obviously. It is that quiet mind, that still mind, which brings \nabout transformation. When the mind is no longer resisting, no longer avoiding, \nno longer discarding or blaming what is but is simply passively aware, then in \nthat passivity of the mind you will find, if you really go into the problem, that \nthere comes a transformation. \nRevolution is only possible now, not in the future; regeneration is today, not \ntomorrow. If you will experiment with what I have been saying, you will find \nthat there is immediate regeneration, a newness, a quality of freshness; because \nthe mind is always still when it is interested, when it desires or has the intention \nto understand. The difficulty with most of us is that we have not the intention to \nunderstand, because we are afraid that, if we understood, it might bring about a \nrevolutionary action in our life and therefore we resist. It is the defence \nmechanism that is at work when we use time or an ideal as a means of gradual \ntransformation. \nThus regeneration is only possible in the present, not in the future, not \ntomorrow. A man who relies on time as a means through which he can gain \nhappiness or realize truth or God is merely deceiving himself; he is living in \nignorance and therefore in conflict. A man who sees that time is not the way out \nof our difficulty and who is therefore free from the false, such a man naturally \nhas the intention to understand; therefore his mind is quiet spontaneously, \nwithout compulsion, without practice. When the mind is still, tranquil, not \nseeking any answer or any solution, neither resisting nor avoiding—it is only \nthen that there can be a regeneration, because then the mind is capable of \nperceiving what is true; and it is truth that liberates, not your effort to be free."

If change is \nthrough conformity to a pattern projected by the mind, through a reasonable, well \nstudied plan, then it is still within the field of the mind; therefore whatever the \nmind calculates becomes the end, the vision for which we are willing to sacrifice \nourselves and others. If you maintain that, then it follows that we as human \nbeings are merely the creation of the mind, which implies conformity, \ncompulsion, brutality, dictatorships, concentration camps—the whole business. \nWhen we worship the mind, all that is implied, is it not? If I realize this, if I see \nthe futility of discipline, of control, if I see that the various forms of suppression \nonly strengthen the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’, then what am I to do? \nTo consider this problem fully we must go into the question of what is \nconsciousness. I wonder if you have thought about it for yourself or have merely \nquoted what authorities have said about consciousness? I do not know how you \nhave understood from your own experience, from your own study of yourself, \nwhat this consciousness implies—not only the consciousness of everyday activity \nand pursuits but the consciousness that is hidden, deeper, richer and much more \ndifficult to get at.

Obviously it is the thinking process, thought. Thought is the result of \nmemory, verbalization; it is the naming, recording and storing up of certain \nexperiences, so as to be able to communicate; at this level there are also various \ninhibitions, controls, sanctions, disciplines. With all this we are quite familiar. \nWhen we go a little deeper there are all the accumulations of the race, the hidden \nmotives, the collective and personal ambitions, prejudices, which are the result of \nperception, contact and desire. This total consciousness, the hidden as well as the \nopen, is centred round the idea of the ‘me’, the self. \nWhen we discuss how to bring about a change we generally mean a change at \nthe superficial level, do we not? Through determination, conclusions, beliefs, \ncontrols, inhibitions, we struggle to reach a superficial end which we want, which \nwe crave for, and we hope to arrive at that with the help of the unconscious, of \nthe deeper layers of the mind; therefore we think it is necessary to uncover the \ndepths of oneself. But there is everlasting conflict between the superficial levels \nand the so-called deeper levels—all psychologists, all those who have pursued \nself-knowledge are fully aware of that. \nWill this inner conflict bring about a change?

How is one to bring about such a \nchange? My consciousness is the sum total of human experience, plus my \nparticular contact with the present; can that bring about a change?

Will conflict bring \nabout fundamental change? I am in constant battle within myself and with \nsociety, am I not? There is a ceaseless conflict going on between what I am and \nwhat I want to be; will this conflict, this struggle bring about a change?

I feel such a process cannot bring about a radical change. Of that one \nmust be completely sure. And if that process cannot bring about a fundamental \ntransformation, a deep inward revolution, then what will? \nHow are you to bring about true revolution? What is the power, the creative \nenergy that brings about that revolution and how is it to be released? You have \ntried disciplines, you have tried the pursuit of ideals and various speculative \ntheories: that you are God, and that if you can realize that Godhood or experience \nthe Atman, the highest, or what you will, then that very realization will bring \nabout a fundamental change. Will it? First you postulate that there is a reality of \nwhich you are a part and build up round it various theories, speculations, beliefs, \ndoctrines, assumptions, according to which you live; by thinking and acting \naccording to that pattern you hope to bring about a fundamental change. Will \nyou? \nSuppose you assume, as most so-called religious people do, that there is in \nyou, fundamentally, deeply, the essence of reality; and that if, through cultivating \nvirtue, through various forms of discipline, control, suppression, denial, sacrifice, \nyou can get into touch with that reality, then the required transformation will be \nbrought about. Is not this assumption still part of thought? Is it not the outcome \nof a conditioned mind, a mind that has been brought up to think in a particular \nway, according to certain patterns? Having created the image, the idea, the \ntheory, the belief, the hope, you then look to your creation to bring about this \nradical change. \nOne must first see the extraordinarily subtle activities of the ‘me’, of the \nmind, one must become aware of the ideas, beliefs, speculations and put them all \naside, for they are really deceptions, are they not?

If one actually realizes \nthat—not speculatively, not imaginatively or foolishly, but actually sees the truth \nthat any activity of the mind in its speculative search, in its philosophical \ngroping, any assumption, any imagination or hope is only self-deception—then \nwhat is the power, the creative energy that brings about this fundamental \ntransformation? \nPerhaps, in coming to this point, we have used the conscious mind; we have \nfollowed the argument, we have opposed or accepted it, we have seen it clearly \nor dimly. To go further and experience more deeply requires a mind that is quiet \nand alert to find out, does it not? It is no longer pursuing ideas because, if you \npursue an idea, there is the thinker following what is being said and so you \nimmediately create duality. If you want to go further into this matter of \nfundamental change, is it not necessary for the active mind to be quiet? Surely it \nis only when the mind is quiet that it can understand the enormous difficulty, the \ncomplex implications of the thinker and the thought as two separate processes, \nthe experiencer and the experienced, the observer and the observed. Revolution, \nthis psychological, creative revolution in which the ‘me’ is not, comes only when \nthe thinker and the thought are one, when there is no duality such as the thinker \ncontrolling thought; and I suggest it is this experience alone that releases the \ncreative energy which in turn brings about a fundamental revolution, the \nbreaking up of the psychological ‘me’. \nWe know the way of power—power through domination, power through \ndiscipline, power through compulsion. Through political power we hope to \nchange fundamentally; but such power only breeds further darkness, \ndisintegration, evil, the strengthening of the ‘me’. We are familiar with the \nvarious forms of acquisition, both individually and as groups, but we have never \ntried the way of love, and we don’t even know what it means. Love is not \npossible so long as there is the thinker, the centre of the ‘me’. Realizing all this, \nwhat is one to do? \nSurely the only thing which can bring about a fundamental change, a creative, \npsychological release, is everyday watchfulness, being aware from moment to \nmoment of our motives, the conscious as well as the unconscious. When we \nrealize that disciplines, beliefs, ideals only strengthen the ‘me’ and are therefore \nutterly futile—when we are aware of that from day to day, see the truth of it, do \nwe not come to the central point when the thinker is constantly separating \nhimself from his thought, from his observations, from his experiences? So long \nas the thinker exists apart from his thought, which he is trying to dominate, there \ncan be no fundamental transformation. So long as the ‘me’ is the observer, the \none who gathers experience, strengthens himself through experience, there can \nbe no radical change, no creative release. That creative release comes only when \nthe thinker is the thought—but the gap cannot be bridged by any effort. When the \nmind realizes that any speculation, any verbalization, any form of thought only \ngives strength to the ‘me’, when it sees that as long as the thinker exists apart \nfrom thought there must be limitation, the conflict of duality—when the mind \nrealizes that, then it is watchful, everlastingly aware of how it is separating itself"

In that awareness, if the mind \npursues it ever more deeply and extensively without seeking an end, a goal, there \ncomes a state in which the thinker and the thought are one. In that state there is \nno effort, there is no becoming, there is no desire to change; in that state the ‘me’ \nis not, for there is a transformation which is not of the mind. \nIt is only when the mind is empty that there is a possibility of creation; but I \ndo not mean this superficial emptiness which most of us have. Most of us are \nsuperficially empty, and it shows itself through the desire for distraction. We \nwant to be amused, so we turn to books, to the radio, we run to lectures, to \nauthorities; the mind is everlastingly filling itself. I am not talking of that \nemptiness which is thoughtlessness. On the contrary, I am talking of the \nemptiness which comes through extraordinary thoughtfulness, when the mind \nsees its own power of creating illusion and goes beyond. \nCreative emptiness is not possible so long as there is the thinker who is \nwaiting, watching, observing in order to gather experience, in order to strengthen \nhimself. Can the mind ever be empty of all symbols, of all words with their \nsensations, so that there is no experiencer who is accumulating? Is it possible for \nthe mind to put aside completely all the reasonings, the experiences, the \nimpositions, authorities, so that it is in a state of emptiness? You will not be able \nto answer this question, naturally; it is an impossible question for you to answer, \nbecause you do not know, you have never tried. But, if I may suggest, listen to it, \nlet the question be put to you, let the seed be sown; and it will bear fruit if you \nreally listen to it, if you do not resist it. \nIt is only the new that can transform, not the old. If you pursue the pattern of \nthe old, any change is a modified continuity of the old; there is nothing new in \nthat, there is nothing creative. The creative can come into being only when the \nmind itself is new; and the mind can renew itself only when it is capable of \nseeing all its own activities, not only at the superficial level, but deep down. \nWhen the mind sees its own activities, is aware of its own desires, demands, \nurges, pursuits, the creation of its own authorities, fears; when it sees in itself the \nresistance created by discipline, by control, and the hope which projects beliefs, \nideals—when the mind sees through, is aware of this whole process, can it put \naside all these things and be new, creatively empty? You will find out whether it \ncan or cannot only if you experiment without having an opinion about it, without \nwanting to experience that creative state. If you want to experience it, you will; \nbut what you experience is not creative emptiness, it is only a projection of \ndesire. If you desire to experience the new, you are merely indulging in illusion; \nbut if you begin to observe, to be aware of your own activities from day to day, \nfrom moment to moment, watching the whole process of yourself as in a mirror, \nthen, as you go deeper and deeper, you will come to the ultimate question of this \nemptiness in which alone there can be the new. \nTruth, God or what you will, is not something to be experienced, for the \nexperiencer is the result of time, the result of memory, of the past, and so long as \nthere is the experiencer there cannot be reality. There is reality only when the \nmind is completely free from the analyser, from the experiencer and the \nexperienced. Then you will find the answer, then you will see that the change"

    "text": "1 .  O N  T H E  P R E S E N T  CR I S I S \n \nQuestion: You say the present crisis is without precedent. In what way is it \nexceptional? \n \nKrishnamurti: Obviously the present crisis throughout the world is exceptional, \nwithout precedent. There have been crises of varying types at different periods \nthroughout history, social, national, political. Crises come and go; economic \nrecessions, depressions, come, get modified, and continue in a different form. We \nknow that; we are familiar with that process. Surely the present crisis is different, \nis it not? It is different first because we are dealing not with money nor with \ntangible things but with ideas. The crisis is exceptional because it is in the field \nof ideation. We are quarrelling with ideas, we are justifying murder; everywhere \nin the world we are justifying murder as a means to a righteous end, which in \nitself is unprecedented. Before, evil was recognized to be evil, murder was \nrecognized to be murder, but now murder is a means to achieve a noble result. \nMurder, whether of one person or of a group of people, is justified, because the \nmurderer, or the group that the murderer represents, justifies it as a means of \nachieving a result which will be beneficial to man. That is we sacrifice the \npresent for the future—and it does not matter what means we employ as long as \nour declared purpose is to produce a result which we say will be beneficial to \nman. Therefore, the implication is that a wrong means will produce a right end \nand you justify the wrong means through ideation. In the various crises that have \ntaken place before, the issue has been the exploitation of things or of man; it is \nnow the exploitation of ideas, which is much more pernicious, much more \ndangerous, because the exploitation of ideas is so devastating, so destructive. We \nhave learned now the power of propaganda and that is one of the greatest \ncalamities that can happen: to use ideas as a means to transform man. That is \nwhat is happening in the world today. Man is not important—systems, ideas, \nhave become important. Man no longer has any significance. We can destroy \nmillions of men as long as we produce a result and the result is justified by ideas. \nWe have a magnificent structure of ideas to justify evil and surely that is \nunprecedented. Evil is evil; it cannot bring about good. War is not a means to \npeace. War may bring about secondary benefits, like more efficient aeroplanes, \nbut it will not bring peace to man. War is intellectually justified as a means of \nbringing peace; when the intellect has the upper hand in human life, it brings \nabout an unprecedented crisis. \nThere are other causes also which indicate an unprecedented crisis. One of \nthem is the extraordinary importance man is giving to sensate values, to property, \nto name, to caste and country, to the particular label you wear. You are either a \nMohammedan or a Hindu, a Christian or a Communist. Name and property, caste \nand country, have become predominantly important, which means that man is \ncaught in sensate value, the value of things, whether made by the mind or by the \nhand. Things made by the hand or by the mind have become so important that we \nare killing, destroying, butchering, liquidating each other because of them. We \nare nearing the edge of a precipice; every action is leading us there, every"

    "text": "political, every economic action is bringing us inevitably to the precipice, \ndragging us into this chaotic, confusing abyss. Therefore the crisis is \nunprecedented and it demands unprecedented action. To leave, to step out of that \ncrisis, needs a timeless action, an action which is not based on idea, on system, \nbecause any action which is based on a system, on an idea, will inevitably lead to \nfrustration. Such action merely brings us back to the abyss by a different route. \nAs the crisis is unprecedented there must also be unprecedented action, which \nmeans that the regeneration of the individual must be instantaneous, not a process \nof time. It must take place now, not tomorrow; for tomorrow is a process of \ndisintegration. If I think of transforming myself tomorrow I invite confusion, I \nam still within the field of destruction. Is it possible to change now? Is it possible \ncompletely to transform oneself in the immediate, in the now? I say it is. \nThe point is that as the crisis is of an exceptional character to meet it there \nmust be revolution in thinking; and this revolution cannot take place through \nanother, through any book, through any organization. It must come through us, \nthrough each one of us. Only then can we create a new society, a new structure \naway from this horror, away from these extraordinarily destructive forces that are \nbeing accumulated, piled up; and that transformation comes into being only when \nyou as an individual begin to be aware of yourself in every thought, action and \nfeeling."

But I am afraid that is not the implication \nin this question. The implication is, what can be substituted for nationalism? Any \nsubstitution is an act which does not bring intelligence. If I leave one religion and \njoin another, or leave one political party and later on join something else, this \nconstant substitution indicates a state in which there is no intelligence. \nHow does nationalism go? Only by our understanding its full implications, by \nexamining it, by being aware of its significance in outward and inward action. \nOutwardly it brings about divisions between people, classifications, wars and \ndestruction, which is obvious to anyone who is observant. Inwardly, \npsychologically, this identification with the greater, with the country, with an \nidea, is obviously a form of self-expansion. Living in a little village or a big town \nor whatever it may be, I am nobody; but if I identify myself with the larger, with \nthe country, if I call myself a Hindu, it flatters my vanity, it gives me \ngratification, prestige, a sense of well-being; and that identification with the \nlarger, which is a psychological necessity for those who feel that self-expansion \nis essential, also creates conflict, strife, between people. Thus nationalism not \nonly creates outward conflict but inward frustrations; when one understands \nnationalism, the whole process of nationalism, it falls away. The understanding \nof nationalism comes through intelligence, by carefully observing, by probing \ninto the whole process of nationalism, patriotism. Out of that examination comes \nintelligence and then there is no substitution of something else for nationalism. \nThe moment you substitute religion for nationalism, religion becomes another \nmeans of self-expansion, another source of psychological anxiety, a means of \nfeeding oneself through a belief. Therefore any form of substitution, however \nnoble, is a form of ignorance. It is like a man substituting chewing gum or betel \nnut or whatever it is for smoking, whereas if one really understands the whole \nproblem of smoking, of habits, sensations, psychological demands and all the rest \nof it, then smoking drops away. You can understand only when there is a \ndevelopment of intelligence, when intelligence is functioning, and intelligence is \nnot functioning when there is substitution. Substitution is merely a form of self-\nbribery, to tempt you not to do this but to do that. Nationalism, with its poison, \nwith its misery and world strife, can disappear only when there is intelligence, \nand intelligence does not come merely by passing examinations and studying \nbooks. Intelligence comes into being when we understand problems as they arise. \nWhen there is understanding of the problem at its different levels, not only of the \noutward part but of its inward, psychological implications, then, in that process, \nintelligence comes into being. So when there is intelligence there is no \nsubstitution; and when there is intelligence, then nationalism, patriotism, which is \na form of stupidity, disappears."

W H Y  S P I R I T U A L  T E A C H E R S ? \n \nQuestion: You say that gurus are unnecessary, but how can I find truth without \nthe wise help and guidance which only a guru can give? \n \nKrishnamurti: The question is whether a guru is necessary or not. Can truth be \nfound through another? Some say it can and some say it cannot. We want to \nknow the truth of this, not my opinion as against the opinion of another. I have \nno opinion in this matter. Either it is so or it is not. Whether it is essential that \nyou should or should not have a guru is not a question of opinion. The truth of \nthe matter is not dependent on opinion, however profound, erudite, popular, \nuniversal. The truth of the matter is to be found out, in fact. \nFirst of all, why do we want a guru? We say we need a guru because we are \nconfused and the guru is helpful; he will point out what truth is, he will help us to \nunderstand, he knows much more about life than we do, he will act as a father, as \na teacher to instruct us in life; he has vast experience and we have but little; he \nwill help us through his greater experience and so on and on. That is, basically, \nyou go to a teacher because you are confused. If you were clear, you would not \ngo near a guru. Obviously if you were profoundly happy, if there were no \nproblems, if you understood life completely, you would not go to any guru. I \nhope you see the significance of this. Because you are confused, you seek out a \nteacher. You go to him to give you a way of life, to clarify your own confusion, \nto find truth. You choose your guru because you are confused and you hope he \nwill give you what you ask. That is you choose a guru who will satisfy your \ndemand; you choose according to the gratification he will give you and your \nchoice is dependent on your gratification. You do not choose a guru who says, \n“Depend on yourself”; you choose him according to your prejudices. So since \nyou choose your guru according to the gratification he gives you, you are not \nseeking truth but a way out of confusion; and the way out of confusion is \nmistakenly called truth. \nLet us examine first this idea that a guru can clear up our confusion. Can \nanyone clear up our confusion?—confusion being the product of our responses. \nWe have created it. Do you think someone else has created it—this misery, this \nbattle at all levels of existence, within and without? It is the result of our own \nlack of knowledge of ourselves. It is because we do not understand ourselves, our \nconflicts, our responses, our miseries, that we go to a guru whom we think will \nhelp us to be free of that confusion. We can understand ourselves only in \nrelationship to the present; and that relationship itself is the guru, not someone \noutside. If I do not understand that relationship, whatever a guru may say is \nuseless, because if I do not understand relationship, my relationship to property, \nto people, to ideas, who can resolve the conflict within me? To resolve that \nconflict, I must understand it myself, which means I must be aware of myself in \nrelationship. To be aware, no guru is necessary. If I do not know myself, of what \nuse is a guru? As a political leader is chosen by those who are in confusion and \nwhose choice therefore is also confused, so I choose a guru. I can choose him \nonly according to my confusion; hence he, like the political leader, is confused."

    "text": "What is important is not who is right—whether I am right or whether those \nare right who say a guru is necessary; to find out why you need a guru is \nimportant. Gurus exist for exploitation of various kinds, but that is irrelevant. It \ngives you satisfaction if someone tells you how you are progressing, but to find \nout why you need a guru—there lies the key. Another can point out the way but \nyou have to do all the work, even if you have a guru. Because you do not want to \nface that, you shift the responsibility to the guru. The guru becomes useless when \nthere is a particle of self-knowledge. No guru, no book or scripture, can give you \nself-knowledge: it comes when you are aware of yourself in relationship. To be, \nis to be related; not to understand relationship is misery, strife. Not to be aware of \nyour relationship to property is one of the causes of confusion. If you do not \nknow your right relationship to property there is bound to be conflict, which \nincreases the conflict in society. If you do not understand the relationship \nbetween yourself and your wife, between yourself and your child, how can \nanother resolve the conflict arising out of that relationship? Similarly with ideas, \nbeliefs and so on. Being confused in your relationship with people, with property, \nwith ideas, you seek a guru. If he is a real guru, he will tell you to understand \nyourself. You are the source of all misunderstanding and confusion; and you can \nresolve that conflict only when you understand yourself in relationship. \nYou cannot find truth through anybody else. How can you? Truth is not \nsomething static; it has no fixed abode; it is not an end, a goal. On the contrary, it \nis living, dynamic, alert, alive. How can it be an end? If truth is a fixed point it is \nno longer truth; it is then a mere opinion. Truth is the unknown, and a mind that \nis seeking truth will never find it, for mind is made up of the known, it is the \nresult of the past, the outcome of time—which you can observe for yourself. \nMind is the instrument of the known, hence it cannot find the unknown; it can \nonly move from the known to the known. When the mind seeks truth, the truth it \nhas read about in books, that ‘truth’ is self-projected; for then the mind is merely \nin pursuit of the known, a more satisfactory known than the previous one. When \nthe mind seeks truth, it is seeking its own self-projection, not truth. After all, an \nideal is self-projected; it is fictitious, unreal. What is real is what is, not the \nopposite. But a mind that is seeking reality, seeking God, is seeking the known. \nWhen you think of God, your God is the projection of your own thought, the \nresult of social influences. You can think only of the known; you cannot think of \nthe unknown, you cannot concentrate on truth. The moment you think of the \nunknown, it is merely the self-projected known. God or truth cannot be thought \nabout. If you think about it, it is not truth. Truth cannot be sought: it comes to \nyou. You can go only after what is known. When the mind is not tortured by the \nknown, by the effects of the known, then only can truth reveal itself. Truth is in \nevery leaf, in every tear; it is to be known from moment to moment. No one can \nlead you to truth; and if anyone leads you, it can only be to the known. \nTruth can only come to the mind that is empty of the known. It comes in a \nstate in which the known is absent, not functioning. The mind is the warehouse \nof the known, the residue of the known; for the mind to be in that state in which \nthe unknown comes into being, it must be aware of itself, of its previous \nexperiences, the conscious as well as the unconscious, of its responses, reactions,"

    "text": "4 .  O N  K N O W L E D G E \n \nQuestion: I gather definitely from you that learning and knowledge are \nimpediments. To what are they impediments? \n \nKrishnamurti: Obviously knowledge and learning are an impediment to the \nunderstanding of the new, the timeless, the eternal. Developing a perfect \ntechnique does not make you creative. You may know how to paint \nmarvellously, you may have the technique; but you may not be a creative painter. \nYou may know how to write poems, technically most perfect; but you may not be \na poet. To be a poet implies, does it not?, being capable of receiving the new; to \nbe sensitive enough to respond to something new, fresh. With most of us \nknowledge or learning has become an addiction and we think that through \nknowing we shall be creative. A mind that is crowded, encased in facts, in \nknowledge—is it capable of receiving something new, sudden, spontaneous? If \nyour mind is crowded with the known, is there any space in it to receive \nsomething that is of the unknown? Surely knowledge is always of the known; \nand with the known we are trying to understand the unknown, something which \nis beyond measure. \nTake, for example, a very ordinary thing that happens to most of us: those \nwho are religious—whatever that word may mean for the moment—try to \nimagine what God is or try to think about what God is. They have read \ninnumerable books, they have read about the experiences of the various saints, \nthe Masters, the Mahatmas and all the rest, and they try to imagine or try to feel \nwhat the experience of another is; that is with the known you try to approach the \nunknown. Can you do it? Can you think of something that is not knowable? You \ncan only think of something that you know. But there is this extraordinary \nperversion taking place in the world at the present time: we think we shall \nunderstand if we have more information, more books, more facts, more printed \nmatter. \nTo be aware of something that is not the projection of the known, there must \nbe the elimination, through the understanding, of the process of the known. Why \nis it that the mind clings always to the known? Is it not because the mind is \nconstantly seeking certainty, security? Its very nature is fixed in the known, in \ntime; how can such a mind, whose very foundation is based on the past, on time, \nexperience the timeless? It may conceive, formulate, picture the unknown, but \nthat is all absurd. The unknown can come into being only when the known is \nunderstood, dissolved, put aside. That is extremely difficult, because the moment \nyou have an experience of anything, the mind translates it into the terms of the \nknown and reduces it to the past. I do not know if you have noticed that every \nexperience is immediately translated into the known, given a name, tabulated and \nrecorded. So the movement of the known is knowledge, and obviously such \nknowledge, learning, is a hindrance. \nSuppose you had never read a book, religious or psychological, and you had \nto find the meaning, the significance of life. How would you set about it? \nSuppose there were no Masters, no religious organizations, no Buddha, no Christ,"

    "text": "and you had to begin from the beginning. How would you set about it? First, you \nwould have to understand your process of thinking, would you not?—and not \nproject yourself, your thoughts, into the future and create a God which pleases \nyou; that would be too childish. So first you would have to understand the \nprocess of your thinking. That is the only way to discover anything new, is it not? \nWhen we say that learning or knowledge is an impediment, a hindrance, we \nare not including technical knowledge—how to drive a car, how to run \nmachinery—or the efficiency which such knowledge brings. We have in mind \nquite a different thing: that sense of creative happiness which no amount of \nknowledge or learning will bring. To be creative in the truest sense of that word \nis to be free of the past from moment to moment, because it is the past that is \ncontinually shadowing the present. Merely to cling to information, to the \nexperiences of others, to what someone has said, however great, and try to \napproximate your action to that—all that is knowledge, is it not? But to discover \nanything new you must start on your own; you must start on a journey \ncompletely denuded, especially of knowledge, because it is very easy, through \nknowledge and belief, to have experiences; but those experiences are merely the \nproducts of self-projection and therefore utterly unreal, false. If you are to \ndiscover for yourself what is the new, it is no good carrying the burden of the \nold, especially knowledge—the knowledge of another, however great. You use \nknowledge as a means of self-protection, security, and you want to be quite sure \nthat you have the same experiences as the Buddha or the Christ or X. But a man \nwho is protecting himself constantly through knowledge is obviously not a truth-\nseeker. \nFor the discovery of truth there is no path. You must enter the uncharted \nsea—which is not depressing, which is not being adventurous. When you want to \nfind something new, when you are experimenting with anything, your mind has \nto be very quiet, has it not? If your mind is crowded, filled with facts, knowledge, \nthey act as an impediment to the new; the difficulty is for most of us that the \nmind has become so important, so predominantly significant, that it interferes \nconstantly with anything that may be new, with anything that may exist \nsimultaneously with the known. Thus knowledge and learning are impediments \nfor those who would seek, for those who would try to understand that which is \ntimeless."

Through self-discipline the saints and mystics \nhave asserted that they have attained godhood. Now you seem to imply that such \ndisciplines are a hindrance to the realization of God. I am confused. Who is right \nin this matter? \n \nKrishnamurti: It is not a question of who is right in this matter. What is \nimportant is to find out the truth of the matter for ourselves—not according to a \nparticular saint or to a person who comes from India or from some other place, \nthe more exotic the better. \nYou are caught between these two: someone says discipline, another says no \ndiscipline. Generally what happens is that you choose what is more convenient, \nwhat is more satisfying: you like the man, his looks, his personal idiosyncrasies, \nhis personal favouritism and all the rest of it. Putting all that aside, let us examine \nthis question directly and find out the truth of the matter for ourselves. In this \nquestion a great deal is implied and we have to approach it very cautiously and \ntentatively. \nMost of us want someone in authority to tell us what to do. We look for a \ndirection in conduct, because our instinct is to be safe, not to suffer more. \nSomeone is said to have realized happiness, bliss or what you will and we hope \nthat he will tell us what to do to arrive there. That is what we want: we want that \nsame happiness, that same inward quietness, joy; and in this mad world of \nconfusion we want someone to tell us what to do. That is really the basic instinct \nwith most of us and, according to that instinct, we pattern our action. Is God, is \nthat highest thing, unnameable and not to be measured by words—is that come \nby through discipline, through following a particular pattern of action? We want \nto arrive at a particular goal, particular end, and we think that by practice, by \ndiscipline, by suppressing or releasing, sublimating or substituting, we shall be \nable to find that which we are seeking. \nWhat is implied in discipline? Why do we discipline ourselves, if we do? Can \ndiscipline and intelligence go together? Most people feel that we must, through \nsome kind of discipline, subjugate or control the brute, the ugly thing in us. Is \nthat brute, that ugly thing, controllable through discipline? What do we mean by \ndiscipline? A course of action which promises a reward, a course of action \nwhich, if pursued, will give us what we want—it may be positive or negative; a \npattern of conduct which, if practised diligently, sedulously, very, very ardently, \nwill give me in the end what I want. It may be painful but I am willing to go \nthrough it to get that. The self, which is aggressive, selfish, hypocritical, anxious, \nfearful—you know, all of it—that self, which is the cause of the brute in us, we \nwant to transform, subjugate, destroy. How is this to be done? Is it to be done \nthrough discipline, or through an intelligent understanding of the past of the self, \nwhat the self is, how it comes into being, and so on?

Non-greed is now profitable, so I \nam pursuing non-greed; but the motive, the intention, is still to be something, to \nbe non-greedy—which is still greed, surely; which is again a negative form of the \nemphasis on the ‘me’. \nWe find that being greedy is painful, for various reasons which are obvious. \nSo long as we enjoy it, so long as it pays us to be greedy, there is no problem. \nSociety encourages us in different ways to be greedy; so do religions encourage \nus in different ways. So long as it is profitable, so long as it is not painful, we \npursue it but the moment it becomes painful we want to resist it. That resistance \nis what we call discipline against greed; but are we free from greed through \nresistance, through sublimation, through suppression? Any act on the part of the \n‘me’ who wants to be free from greed is still greed. Therefore any action, any \nresponse on my part with regard to greed, is obviously not the solution. \nFirst of all there must be a quiet mind, an undisturbed mind, to understand \nanything, especially something which I do not know, something which my mind \ncannot fathom—which, this questioner says, is God. To understand anything, any \nintricate problem—of life or relationship, in fact any problem—there must be a \ncertain quiet depth to the mind. Is that quiet depth come by through any form of \ncompulsion? The superficial mind may compel itself, make itself quiet; but \nsurely such quietness is the quietness of decay, death. It is not capable of \nadaptability, pliability, sensitivity. So resistance is not the way. \nNow to see that requires intelligence, doesn’t it? To see that the mind is made \ndull by compulsion is already the beginning of intelligence, isn’t it?—to see that \ndiscipline is merely conformity to a pattern of action through fear. That is what is \nimplied in disciplining ourselves: we are afraid of not getting what we want. \nWhat happens when you discipline the mind, when you discipline your being? It \nbecomes very hard, doesn’t it?; unpliable, not quick, not adjustable. Don’t you \nknow people who have disciplined themselves—if there are such people? The"

There is an inward conflict which is put \naway, hidden away; but it is there, burning. \nThus we see that discipline, which is resistance, merely creates a habit and \nhabit obviously cannot be productive of intelligence: habit never is, practice \nnever is. You may become very clever with your fingers by practising the piano \nall day, making something with your hands; but intelligence is demanded to \ndirect the hands and we are now inquiring into that intelligence. \nYou see somebody whom you consider happy or as having realized, and he \ndoes certain things; you, wanting that happiness, imitate him. This imitation is \ncalled discipline, isn’t it? We imitate in order to receive what another has; we \ncopy in order to be happy, which you think he is. Is happiness found through \ndiscipline? By practising a certain rule, by practising a certain discipline, a mode \nof conduct, are you ever free? Surely there must be freedom for discovery, must \nthere not? If you would discover anything, you must be free inwardly, which is \nobvious. Are you free by shaping your mind in a particular way which you call \ndiscipline? Obviously you are not. You are merely a repetitive machine, resisting \naccording to a certain conclusion, according to a certain mode of conduct. \nFreedom cannot come through discipline. Freedom can only come into being \nwith intelligence; and that intelligence is awakened, or you have that intelligence, \nthe moment you see that any form of compulsion denies freedom, inwardly or \noutwardly. \nThe first requirement, not as a discipline, is obviously freedom; only virtue \ngives that freedom. Greed is confusion; anger is confusion; bitterness is \nconfusion. When you see that, obviously you are free of them; you do not resist \nthem but you see that only in freedom can you discover and that any form of \ncompulsion is not freedom, and therefore there is no discovery. What virtue does \nis to give you freedom. The unvirtuous person is a confused person; in confusion, \nhow can you discover anything? How can you? Thus virtue is not the end-\nproduct of a discipline, but virtue is freedom and freedom cannot come through \nany action which is not virtuous, which is not true in itself. Our difficulty is that \nmost of us have read so much, most of us have superficially followed so many \ndisciplines—getting up every morning at a certain hour, sitting in a certain \nposture, trying to hold our minds in a certain way—you know, practise, practise, \ndiscipline, because you have been told that if you do these things for a number of \nyears you will have God at the end of it. I may put it crudely, but that is the basis \nof our thinking. Surely God doesn’t come so easily as all that? God is not a mere \nmarketable thing: I do this and you give me that. \nMost of us are so conditioned by external influences, by religious doctrines, \nbeliefs, and by our own inward demand to arrive at something, to gain \nsomething, that it is very difficult for us to think of this problem anew without \nthinking in terms of discipline. First we must see very clearly the implications of \ndiscipline, how it narrows down the mind, limits the mind, compels the mind to a \nparticular action, through our desire, through influence and all the rest of it; a \nconditioned mind, however ‘virtuous’ that conditioning, cannot possibly be free \nand therefore cannot understand reality. God, reality or what you will—the name \ndoesn’t matter—can come into being only when there is freedom, and there is no"

    "text": "freedom where there is compulsion, positive or negative, through fear. There is \nno freedom if you are seeking an end, for you are tied to that end. You may be \nfree from the past but the future holds you, and that is not freedom. It is only in \nfreedom that one can discover anything: new idea, a new feeling, a new \nperception. Any form of discipline which is based on compulsion denies that \nfreedom, whether political or religious; and since discipline, which is conformity \nto an action with an end in view, is binding, the mind can never be free. It can \nfunction only within that groove, like a gramophone record. \nThus, through practice, through habit, through cultivation of a pattern, the \nmind only achieves what it has in view. Therefore it is not free; therefore it \ncannot realize that which is immeasurable. To be aware of that whole process—\nwhy you are constantly disciplining yourself to public opinion; to certain saints; \nthe whole business of conforming to opinion, whether of a saint or of a \nneighbour, it is all the same—to be aware of this whole conformity through \npractice, through subtle ways of submitting yourself, of denying, asserting, \nsuppressing, sublimating, all implying conformity to a pattern: this is already the \nbeginning of freedom, from which there is a virtue. Virtue surely is not the \ncultivation of a particular idea. Non-greed, for instance, if pursued as an end is no \nlonger virtue, is it? That is if you are conscious that you are non-greedy, are you \nvirtuous? That is what we are doing through discipline. \nDiscipline, conformity, practice, only give emphasis to self-consciousness as \nbeing something. The mind practises non-greed and therefore it is not free from \nits own consciousness as being non-greedy; therefore, it is not really non-greedy. \nIt has merely taken on a new cloak which it calls non-greed. We can see the total \nprocess of all this: the motivation, the desire for an end, the conformity to a \npattern, the desire to be secure in pursuing a pattern—all this is merely the \nmoving from the known to the known, always within the limits of the mind’s \nown self-enclosing process. To see all this, to be aware of it, is the beginning of \nintelligence, and intelligence is neither virtuous nor non-virtuous, it cannot be \nfitted into a pattern as virtue or non-virtue. Intelligence brings freedom, which is \nnot licentiousness, not disorder. Without this intelligence there can be no virtue; \nvirtue gives freedom and in freedom there comes into being reality. If you see the \nwhole process totally, in its entirety, then you will find there is no conflict. It is \nbecause we are in conflict and because we want to escape from that conflict that \nwe resort to various forms of disciplines, denials and adjustments. When we see \nwhat is the process of conflict there is no question of discipline, because then we \nunderstand from moment to moment the ways of conflict. That requires great \nalertness, watching yourself all the time; the curious part of it is that although \nyou may not be watchful all the time there is a recording process going on \ninwardly, once the intention is there—the sensitivity, the inner sensitivity, is \ntaking the picture all the time, so that the inner will project that picture the \nmoment you are quiet. \nTherefore, it is not a question of discipline. Sensitivity can never come into \nbeing through compulsion. You may compel a child to do something, put him in \na corner, and he may be quiet; but inwardly he is probably seething, looking out \nof the window, doing something to get away. That is what we are still doing. So"

On the contrary, the unknown must have freedom \nand not the pattern of your mind. That is why the tranquillity of the mind is \nessential.

Do you \nknow what loneliness means and are you aware of it? I doubt it very much, \nbecause we have smothered ourselves in activities, in books, in relationships, in \nideas which really prevent us from being aware of loneliness. What do we mean \nby loneliness? It is a sense of being empty, of having nothing, of being \nextraordinarily uncertain, with no anchorage anywhere. It is not despair, nor \nhopelessness, but a sense of void, a sense of emptiness and a sense of frustration. \nI am sure we have all felt it, the happy and the unhappy, the very, very active and \nthose who are addicted to knowledge. They all know this. It is the sense of real \ninexhaustible pain, a pain that cannot be covered up, though we do try to cover it \nup. \nLet us approach this problem again to see what is actually taking place, to see \nwhat you do when you feel lonely. You try to escape from your feeling of \nloneliness, you try to get on with a book, you follow some leader, or you go to a \ncinema, or you become socially very, very active, or you go and worship and \npray, or you paint, or you write a poem about loneliness. That is what is actually \ntaking place. Becoming aware of loneliness, the pain of it, the extraordinary and \nfathomless fear of it, you seek an escape and that escape becomes more \nimportant and therefore your activities, your knowledge, your gods, your radios \nall become important, don’t they? When you give importance to secondary \nvalues, they lead you to misery and chaos; the secondary values are inevitably \nthe sensate values; and modern civilization based on these gives you this \nescape—escape through your job, your family, your name, your studies, through \npainting etc.; all our culture is based on that escape. Our civilization is founded \non it and that is a fact. \nHave you ever tried to be alone? When you do try, you will feel how \nextraordinarily difficult it is and how extraordinarily intelligent we must be to be \nalone, because the mind will not let us be alone. The mind becomes restless, it \nbusies itself with escapes, so what are we doing? We are trying to fill this \nextraordinary void with the known. We discover how to be active, how to be \nsocial; we know how to study, how to turn on the radio. We are filling that thing \nwhich we do not know with the things we know. We try to fill that emptiness \nwith various kinds of knowledge, relationship or things. Is that not so? That is \nour process, that is our existence. Now when you realize what you are doing, do \nyou still think you can fill that void? You have tried every means of filling this \nvoid of loneliness. Have you succeeded in filling it? You have tried cinemas and \nyou did not succeed and therefore you go after your gurus and your books or you \nbecome very active socially. Have you succeeded in filling it or have you merely \ncovered it up? If you have merely covered it up, it is still there; therefore it will \ncome back. If you are able to escape altogether then you are locked up in an \nasylum or you become very, very dull. That is what is happening in the world."

If we have experienced and found one escape to be of no value, \nare not all other escapes therefore of no value? It does not matter whether you fill \nthe emptiness with this or with that. So-called meditation is also an escape. It \ndoes not matter much that you change your way of escape. \nHow then will you find what to do about this loneliness? You can only find \nwhat to do when you have stopped escaping. Is that not so? When you are willing \nto face what is—which means you must not turn on the radio, which means you \nmust turn your back to civilization—then that loneliness comes to an end, \nbecause it is completely transformed. It is no longer loneliness. If you understand \nwhat is then what is is the real. Because the mind is continuously avoiding, \nescaping, refusing to see what is, it creates its own hindrances. Because we have \nso many hindrances that are preventing us from seeing, we do not understand \nwhat is and therefore we are getting away from reality; all these hindrances have \nbeen created by the mind in order not to see what is. To see what is not only \nrequires a great deal of capacity and awareness of action but it also means \nturning your back on everything that you have built up, your bank account, your \nname and everything that we call civilization.

    "text": "7 .  O N  S U F F E R IN G \n \nQuestion: What is the significance of pain and suffering? \n \nKrishnamurti: When you suffer, when you have pain, what is the significance of \nit? Physical pain has one significance but probably we mean psychological pain \nand suffering, which has quite a different significance at different levels. What is \nthe significance of suffering? Why do you want to find the significance of \nsuffering? Not that it has no significance—we are going to find out. But why do \nyou want to find it? Why do you want to find out why you suffer? When you put \nthat question to yourself, “Why do I suffer?”, and are looking for the cause of \nsuffering, are you not escaping from suffering? When I seek the significance of \nsuffering, am I not avoiding, evading it, running away from it? The fact is, I am \nsuffering; but the moment I bring the mind to operate upon it and say, “Now, \nwhy?”, I have already diluted the intensity of suffering. In other words, we want \nsuffering to be diluted, alleviated, put away, explained away. Surely that doesn’t \ngive an understanding of suffering. If I am free from that desire to run away from \nit, then I begin to understand what is the content of suffering. \nWhat is suffering? A disturbance, isn’t it?, at different levels—at the physical \nand at the different levels of the subconscious. It is an acute form of disturbance \nwhich I don’t like. My son is dead. I have built round him all my hopes—or \nround my daughter, my husband, what you will. I have enshrined him with all the \nthings I wanted him to be and I have kept him as my companion—you know, all \nthat sort of thing. Suddenly he is gone. So there is a disturbance, isn’t there? That \ndisturbance I call suffering. \nIf I don’t like that suffering, then I say “Why am I suffering?”, “I loved him \nso much”, “He was this”, “I had that”. I try to escape in words, in labels, in \nbeliefs, as most of us do. They act as a narcotic. If I do not do that, what \nhappens? I am simply aware of suffering. I don’t condemn it, I don’t justify it—I \nam suffering. Then I can follow its movement, can’t I? Then I can follow the \nwhole content of what it means—‘I follow’ in the sense of trying to understand \nsomething. \nWhat does it mean? What is it that is suffering? Not why there is suffering, \nnot what is the cause of suffering, but what is actually happening? I do not know \nif you see the difference. Then I am simply aware of suffering, not as apart from \nme, not as an observer watching suffering—it is part of me, that is the whole of \nme is suffering. Then I am able to follow its movement, see where it leads. \nSurely if I do that it opens up, does it not? Then I see that I have laid emphasis on \nthe ‘me’—not on the person whom I love. He only acted to cover me from my \nmisery, from my loneliness, from my misfortune. As I am not something, I hoped \nhe would be that. That has gone; I am left, I am lost, I am lonely. Without him, I \nam nothing. So I cry. It is not that he is gone but that I am left. I am alone. To \ncome to that point is very difficult, isn’t it? It is difficult really to recognize it and \nnot merely say, “I am alone and how am I to get rid of that loneliness?”, which is \nanother form of escape, but to be conscious of it, to remain with it, to see its \nmovement. I am only taking this as an example. Gradually, if I allow it to unfold,"

There are \ninnumerable people to help me to escape—thousands of so-called religious \npeople, with their beliefs and dogmas, hopes and fantasies—“it is karma, it is \nGod’s will”—you know, all giving me a way out. But if I can stay with it and not \nput it away from me, not try to circumscribe or deny it, then what happens? What \nis the state of my mind when it is thus following the movement of suffering? \nIs suffering merely a word, or an actuality? If it is an actuality and not just a \nword, then the word has no meaning now, so there is merely the feeling of \nintense pain. With regard to what? With regard to an image, to an experience, to \nsomething which you have or have not. If you have it, you call it pleasure; if you \nhaven’t it is pain. Therefore pain, sorrow, is in relationship to something. Is that \nsomething merely a verbalization, or an actuality? That is when sorrow exists, it \nexists only in relationship to something. It cannot exist by itself—even as fear \ncannot exist by itself but only in relationship to something: to an individual, to an \nincident, to a feeling. Now, you are fully aware of the suffering. Is that suffering \napart from you and therefore you are merely the observer who perceives the \nsuffering, or is that suffering you? \nWhen there is no observer who is suffering, is the suffering different from \nyou? You are the suffering, are you not? You are not apart from the pain—you \nare the pain. What happens? There is no labelling, there is no giving it a name \nand thereby brushing it aside—you are merely that pain, that feeling, that sense \nof agony. When you are that, what happens? When you do not name it, when \nthere is no fear with regard to it, is the centre related to it? If the centre is related \nto it, then it is afraid of it. Then it must act and do something about it. But if the \ncentre is that, then what do you do? There is nothing to be done, is there? If you \nare that and you are not accepting it, not labelling it, not pushing it aside—if you \nare that thing, what happens? Do you say you suffer then? Surely, a fundamental \ntransformation has taken place. Then there is no longer “I suffer”, because there \nis no centre to suffer and the centre suffers because we have never examined \nwhat the centre is. We just live from word to word, from reaction to reaction. We \nnever say, “Let me see what that thing is that suffers”. You cannot see by \nenforcement, by discipline. You must look with interest, with spontaneous \ncomprehension. Then you will see that the thing we call suffering, pain, the thing \nthat we avoid, and the discipline, have all gone. As long as I have no relationship \nto the thing as outside me, the problem is not; the moment I establish a \nrelationship with it outside me, the problem is. As long as I treat suffering as \nsomething outside—I suffer because I lost my brother, because I have no money, \nbecause of this or that—I establish a relationship to it and that relationship is \nfictitious. But if I am that thing, if I see the fact, then the whole thing is \ntransformed, it all has a different meaning. Then there is full attention, integrated \nattention and that which is completely regarded is understood and dissolved, and \nso there is no fear and therefore the word ‘sorrow’ is non-existent."

    "text": "8 .  O N  A W A R E N E S S \n \nQuestion: What is the difference between awareness and introspection? And who \nis aware in awareness? \n \nKrishnamurti: Let us first examine what we mean by introspection. We mean by \nintrospection looking within oneself, examining oneself. Why does one examine \noneself? In order to improve, in order to change, in order to modify. You \nintrospect in order to become something, otherwise you would not indulge in \nintrospection. You would not examine yourself if there were not the desire to \nmodify, change, to become something other than what you are. That is the \nobvious reason for introspection. I am angry and I introspect, examine myself, in \norder to get rid of anger or to modify or change anger. Where there is \nintrospection, which is the desire to modify or change the responses, the \nreactions of the self, there is always an end in view; when that end is not \nachieved, there is moodiness, depression. Therefore introspection invariably goes \nwith depression. I don’t know if you have noticed that when you introspect, when \nyou look into yourself in order to change yourself, there is always a wave of \ndepression. There is always a moody wave which you have to battle against; you \nhave to examine yourself again in order to overcome that mood and so on. \nIntrospection is a process in which there is no release because it is a process of \ntransforming what is into something which it is not. Obviously that is exactly \nwhat is taking place when we introspect, when we indulge in that peculiar action. \nIn that action, there is always an accumulative process, the ‘I’ examining \nsomething in order to change it, so there is always a dualistic conflict and \ntherefore a process of frustration. There is never a release; and, realizing that \nfrustration, there is depression. \nAwareness is entirely different. Awareness is observation without \ncondemnation. Awareness brings understanding, because there is no \ncondemnation or identification but silent observation. If I want to understand \nsomething, I must observe, I must not criticize, I must not condemn, I must not \npursue it as pleasure or avoid it as non-pleasure. There must merely be the silent \nobservation of a fact. There is no end in view but awareness of everything as it \narises. That observation and the understanding of that observation cease when \nthere is condemnation, identification, or justification. Introspection is self-\nimprovement and therefore introspection is self-centredness. Awareness is not \nself-improvement. On the contrary, it is the ending of the self, of the ‘I’, with all \nits peculiar idiosyncrasies, memories, demands and pursuits. In introspection \nthere is identification and condemnation. In awareness there is no condemnation \nor identification; therefore there is no self-improvement. There is a vast \ndifference between the two. \nThe man who wants to improve himself can never be aware, because \nimprovement implies condemnation and the achievement of a result. Whereas in \nawareness there is observation without condemnation, without denial or \nacceptance. That awareness begins with outward things, being aware, being in \ncontact with objects, with nature. First, there is awareness of things about one,"

    "text": "being sensitive to objects, to nature, then to people, which means relationship; \nthen there is awareness of ideas. This awareness, being sensitive to things, to \nnature, to people, to ideas, is not made up of separate processes, but is one \nunitary process. It is a constant observation of everything, of every thought and \nfeeling and action as they arise within oneself. As awareness is not \ncondemnatory, there is no accumulation. You condemn only when you have a \nstandard, which means there is accumulation and therefore improvement of the \nself. Awareness is to understand the activities of the self, the ‘I’, in its \nrelationship with people, with ideas and with things. That awareness is from \nmoment to moment and therefore it cannot be practised. When you practise a \nthing, it becomes a habit and awareness is not habit. A mind that is habitual is \ninsensitive, a mind that is functioning within the groove of a particular action is \ndull, unpliable, whereas awareness demands constant pliability, alertness. This is \nnot difficult. It is what you actually do when you are interested in something, \nwhen you are interested in watching your child, your wife, your plants, the trees, \nthe birds. You observe without condemnation, without identification; therefore in \nthat observation there is complete communion; the observer and the observed are \ncompletely in communion. This actually takes place when you are deeply, \nprofoundly interested in something. \nThus there is a vast difference between awareness and the self-expansive \nimprovement of introspection. Introspection leads to frustration, to further and \ngreater conflict; whereas awareness is a process of release from the action of the \nself; it is to be aware of your daily movements, of your thoughts, of your actions \nand to be aware of another, to observe him. You can do that only when you love \nsomebody, when you are deeply interested in something; when I want to know \nmyself, my whole being, the whole content of myself and not just one or two \nlayers, then there obviously must be no condemnation. Then I must be open to \nevery thought, to every feeling, to all the moods, to all the suppressions; and as \nthere is more and more expansive awareness, there is greater and greater freedom \nfrom all the hidden movement of thoughts, motives and pursuits. Awareness is \nfreedom, it brings freedom, it yields freedom, whereas introspection cultivates \nconflict, the process of self-enclosure; therefore there is always frustration and \nfear in it. \nThe questioner also wants to know who is aware. When you have a profound \nexperience of any kind, what is taking place? When there is such an experience, \nare you aware that you are experiencing? When you are angry, at the split second \nof anger or of jealousy or of joy, are you aware that you are joyous or that you \nare angry? It is only when the experience is over that there is the experiencer and \nthe experienced. Then the experiencer observes the experienced, the object of \nexperience. At the moment of experience, there is neither the observer nor the \nobserved: there is only the experiencing. Most of us are not experiencing. We are \nalways outside the state of experiencing and therefore we ask this question as to \nwho is the observer, who is it that is aware? Surely such a question is a wrong \nquestion, is it not? The moment there is experiencing, there is neither the person \nwho is aware nor the object of which he is aware. There is neither the observer \nnor the observed but only a state of experiencing. Most of us find it is extremely"

A man who does not \ndemand anything, who is not seeking an end, who is not searching out a result \nwith all its implications, such a man is in a state of constant experiencing. \nEverything then has a movement, a meaning; nothing is old, nothing is charred, \nnothing is repetitive, because what is is never old. The challenge is always new. \nIt is only the response to the challenge that is old; the old creates further residue, \nwhich is memory, the observer, who separates himself from the observed, from \nthe challenge, from the experience. \nYou can experiment with this for yourself very simply and very easily. Next \ntime you are angry or jealous or greedy or violent or whatever it may be, watch \nyourself. In that state, ‘you’ are not. There is only that state of being. The \nmoment, the second afterwards, you term it, you name it, you call it jealousy, \nanger, greed; so you have created immediately the observer and the observed, the \nexperiencer and the experienced. When there is the experiencer and the \nexperienced, then the experiencer tries to modify the experience, change it, \nremember things about it and so on, and therefore maintains the division between \nhimself and the experienced. If you don’t name that feeling—which means you \nare not seeking a result, you are not condemning, you are merely silently aware \nof the feeling—then you will see that in that state of feeling, of experiencing, \nthere is no observer and no observed, because the observer and the observed are a \njoint phenomenon and so there is only experiencing. \nTherefore introspection and awareness are entirely different. Introspection \nleads to frustration, to further conflict, for in it is implied the desire for change \nand change is merely a modified continuity. Awareness is a state in which there \nis no condemnation, no justification or identification, and therefore there is \nunderstanding; in that state of passive, alert awareness there is neither the \nexperiencer nor the experienced. \nIntrospection, which is a form of self-improvement, of self-expansion, can \nnever lead to truth, because it is always a process of self-enclosure; whereas \nawareness is a state in which truth can come into being, the truth of what is, the \nsimple truth of daily existence. It is only when we understand the truth of daily \nexistence that we can go far. You must begin near to go far but most of us want \nto jump, to begin far without understanding what is close. As we understand the \nnear, we shall find the distance between the near and the far is not. There is no \ndistance—the beginning and the end are one."

    "text": "9 .  O N  R E L A T I ON S H I P \n \nQuestion: You have often talked of relationship. What does it mean to you? \n \nKrishnamurti: First of all, there is no such thing as being isolated. To be is to be \nrelated and without relationship there is no existence. What do we mean by \nrelationship? It is an interconnected challenge and response between two people, \nbetween you and me, the challenge which you throw out and which I accept or to \nwhich I respond; also the challenge I throw out to you. The relationship of two \npeople creates society; society is not independent of you and me; the mass is not \nby itself a separate entity but you and I in our relationship to each other create the \nmass, the group, the society. Relationship is the awareness of interconnection \nbetween two people. What is that relationship generally based on? Is it not based \non so-called interdependence, mutual assistance? At least, we say it is mutual \nhelp, mutual aid and so on, but actually, apart from words, apart from the \nemotional screen which we throw up against each other, what is it based upon? \nOn mutual gratification, is it not? If I do not please you, you get rid of me; if I \nplease you, you accept me either as your wife or as your neighbour or as your \nfriend. That is the fact. \nWhat is it that you call the family? Obviously it is a relationship of intimacy, \nof communion. In your family, in your relationship with your wife, with your \nhusband, is there communion? Surely that is what we mean by relationship, do \nwe not? Relationship means communion without fear, freedom to understand \neach other, to communicate directly. Obviously relationship means that—to be in \ncommunion with another. Are you? Are you in communion with your wife? \nPerhaps you are physically but that is not relationship. You and your wife live on \nopposite sides of a wall of isolation, do you not? You have your own pursuits, \nyour ambitions, and she has hers. You live behind the wall and occasionally look \nover the top—and that you call relationship. That is a fact, is it not? You may \nenlarge it, soften it, introduce a new set of words to describe it but that is the \nfact—that you and another live in isolation, and that life in isolation you call \nrelationship. \nIf there is real relationship between two people, which means there is \ncommunion between them, then the implications are enormous. Then there is no \nisolation; there is love and not responsibility or duty. It is the people who are \nisolated behind their walls who talk about duty and responsibility. A man who \nloves does not talk about responsibility—he loves. Therefore he shares with \nanother his joy, his sorrow, his money. Are your families such? Is there direct \ncommunion with your wife, with your children? Obviously not. Therefore the \nfamily is merely an excuse to continue your name or tradition, to give you what \nyou want, sexually or psychologically, so the family becomes a means of self-\nperpetuation, of carrying on your name. That is one kind of immortality, one kind \nof permanency. The family is also used as a means of gratification. I exploit \nothers ruthlessly in the business world, in the political or social world outside, \nand at home I try to be kind and generous. How absurd! Or the world is too much \nfor me, I want peace and I go home. I suffer in the world and I go home and try"

    "text": "to find comfort. So I use relationship as a means of gratification, which means I \ndo not want to be disturbed by my relationship. \nThus relationship is sought where there is mutual satisfaction, gratification; \nwhen you do not find that satisfaction you change relationship; either you \ndivorce or you remain together but seek gratification elsewhere or else you move \nfrom one relationship to another till you find what you seek—which is \nsatisfaction, gratification, and a sense of self-protection and comfort. After all, \nthat is our relationship in the world, and it is thus in fact. Relationship is sought \nwhere there can be security, where you as an individual can live in a state of \nsecurity, in a state of gratification, in a state of ignorance—all of which always \ncreates conflict, does it not? If you do not satisfy me and I am seeking \nsatisfaction, naturally there must be conflict, because we are both seeking \nsecurity in each other; when that security becomes uncertain you become jealous, \nyou become violent, you become possessive and so on. So relationship invariably \nresults in possession, in condemnation, in self-assertive demands for security, for \ncomfort and for gratification, and in that there is naturally no love. \nWe talk about love, we talk about responsibility, duty, but there is really no \nlove; relationship is based on gratification, the effect of which we see in the \npresent civilization. The way we treat our wives, children, neighbours, friends is \nan indication that in our relationship there is really no love at all. It is merely a \nmutual search for gratification. As this is so, what then is the purpose of \nrelationship? What is its ultimate significance? If you observe yourself in \nrelationship with others, do you not find that relationship is a process of self-\nrevelation? Does not my contact with you reveal my own state of being if I am \naware, if I am alert enough to be conscious of my own reaction in relationship? \nRelationship is really a process of self-revelation, which is a process of self-\nknowledge; in that revelation there are many unpleasant things, disquieting, \nuncomfortable thoughts, activities. Since I do not like what I discover, I run away \nfrom a relationship which is not pleasant to a relationship which is pleasant. \nTherefore, relationship has very little significance when we are merely seeking \nmutual gratification but becomes extraordinarily significant when it is a means of \nself-revelation and self-knowledge. \nAfter all, there is no relationship in love, is there? It is only when you love \nsomething and expect a return of your love that there is a relationship. When you \nlove, that is when you give yourself over to something entirely, wholly, then \nthere is no relationship. \nIf you do love, if there is such a love, then it is a marvellous thing. In such \nlove there is no friction, there is not the one and the other, there is complete \nunity. It is a state of integration, a complete being. There are such moments, such \nrare, happy, joyous moments, when there is complete love, complete \ncommunion. What generally happens is that love is not what is important but the \nother, the object of love becomes important; the one to whom love is given \nbecomes important and not love itself. Then the object of love, for various \nreasons, either biological, verbal or because of a desire for gratification, for \ncomfort and so on, becomes important and love recedes. Then possession, \njealousy and demands create conflict and love recedes further and further; the"

    "text": "further it recedes, the more the problem of relationship loses its significance, its \nworth and its meaning. Therefore, love is one of the most difficult things to \ncomprehend. It cannot come through an intellectual urgency, it cannot be \nmanufactured by various methods and means and disciplines. It is a state of being \nwhen the activities of the self have ceased; but they will not cease if you merely \nsuppress them, shun them or discipline them. You must understand the activities \nof the self in all the different layers of consciousness. We have moments when \nwe do love, when there is no thought, no motive, but those moments are very \nrare. Because they are rare we cling to them in memory and thus create a barrier \nbetween living reality and the action of our daily existence. \nIn order to understand relationship it is important to understand first of all \nwhat is, what is actually taking place in our lives, in all the different subtle forms; \nand also what relationship actually means. Relationship is self-revelation, it is \nbecause we do not want to be revealed to ourselves that we hide in comfort, and \nthen relationship loses its extraordinary depth, significance and beauty. There can \nbe true relationship only when there is love but love is not the search for \ngratification. Love exists only when there is self-forgetfulness, when there is \ncomplete communion, not between one or two, but communion with the highest; \nand that can only take place when the self is forgotten."

    "text": "1 0 .  O N  W A R \n \nQuestion: How can we solve our present political chaos and the crisis in the \nworld? Is there anything an individual can do to stop the impending war? \n \nKrishnamurti: War is the spectacular and bloody projection of our everyday life, \nis it not? War is merely an outward expression of our inward state, an \nenlargement of our daily action. It is more spectacular, more bloody, more \ndestructive, but it is the collective result of our individual activities. Therefore, \nyou and I are responsible for war and what can we do to stop it? Obviously the \never-impending war cannot be stopped by you and me, because it is already in \nmovement; it is already taking place, though at present chiefly on the \npsychological level. As it is already in movement, it cannot be stopped—the \nissues are too many, too great, and are already committed. But you and I, seeing \nthat the house is on fire, can understand the causes of that fire, can go away from \nit and build in a new place with different materials that are not combustible, that \nwill not produce other wars. That is all that we can do. You and I can see what \ncreates wars, and if we are interested in stopping wars, then we can begin to \ntransform ourselves, who are the causes of war. \nAn American lady came to see me a couple of years ago, during the war. She \nsaid she had lost her son in Italy and that she had another son aged sixteen whom \nshe wanted to save; so we talked the thing over. I suggested to her that to save \nher son she had to cease to be an American; she had to cease to be greedy, cease \npiling up wealth, seeking power, domination, and be morally simple—not merely \nsimple in clothes, in outward things, but simple in her thoughts and feelings, in \nher relationships. She said, “That is too much. You are asking far too much. I \ncannot do it, because circumstances are too powerful for me to alter”. Therefore \nshe was responsible for the destruction of her son. \nCircumstances can be controlled by us, because we have created the \ncircumstances. Society is the product of relationship, of yours and mine together. \nIf we change in our relationship, society changes; merely to rely on legislation, \non compulsion, for the transformation of outward society, while remaining \ninwardly corrupt, while continuing inwardly to seek power, position, domination, \nis to destroy the outward, however carefully and scientifically built. That which \nis inward is always overcoming the outward. \nWhat causes war—religious, political or economic? Obviously belief, either \nin nationalism, in an ideology, or in a particular dogma. If we had no belief but \ngoodwill, love and consideration between us, then there would be no wars. But \nwe are fed on beliefs, ideas and dogmas and therefore we breed discontent. The \npresent crisis is of an exceptional nature and we as human beings must either \npursue the path of constant conflict and continuous wars, which are the result of \nour everyday action, or else see the causes of war and turn our back upon them. \nObviously what causes war is the desire for power, position, prestige, money; \nalso the disease called nationalism, the worship of a flag; and the disease of \norganized religion, the worship of a dogma. All these are the causes of war; if \nyou as an individual belong to any of the organized religions, if you are greedy"

So again it depends upon you and not on the leaders—not \non so-called statesmen and all the rest of them. It depends upon you and me but \nwe do not seem to realize that. If once we really felt the responsibility of our own \nactions, how quickly we could bring to an end all these wars, this appalling \nmisery! But you see, we are indifferent. We have three meals a day, we have our \njobs, we have our bank accounts, big or little, and we say, “For God’s sake, don’t \ndisturb us, leave us alone”. The higher up we are, the more we want security, \npermanency, tranquillity, the more we want to be left alone, to maintain things \nfixed as they are; but they cannot be maintained as they are, because there is \nnothing to maintain. Everything is disintegrating. We do not want to face these \nthings, we do not want to face the fact that you and I are responsible for wars. \nYou and I may talk about peace, have conferences, sit round a table and discuss, \nbut inwardly, psychologically, we want power, position, we are motivated by \ngreed. We intrigue, we are nationalistic, we are bound by beliefs, by dogmas, for \nwhich we are willing to die and destroy each other. Do you think such men, you \nand I, can have peace in the world? To have peace, we must be peaceful; to live \npeacefully means not to create antagonism. Peace is not an ideal. To me, an ideal \nis merely an escape, an avoidance of what is, a contradiction of what is. An ideal \nprevents direct action upon what is. To have peace, we will have to love, we will \nhave to begin not to live an ideal life but to see things as they are and act upon \nthem, transform them. As long as each one of us is seeking psychological \nsecurity, the physiological security we need—food, clothing and shelter—is \ndestroyed. We are seeking psychological security, which does not exist; and we \nseek it, if we can, through power, through position, through titles, names—all of \nwhich is destroying physical security. This is an obvious fact, if you look at it. \nTo bring about peace in the world, to stop all wars, there must be a revolution \nin the individual, in you and me. Economic revolution without this inward \nrevolution is meaningless, for hunger is the result of the maladjustment of \neconomic conditions produced by our psychological states—greed, envy, ill will \nand possessiveness. To put an end to sorrow, to hunger, to war, there must be a \npsychological revolution and few of us are willing to face that. We will discuss \npeace, plan legislation, create new leagues, the United Nations and so on and on; \nbut we will not win peace because we will not give up our position, our authority, \nour money, our properties, our stupid lives. To rely on others is utterly futile; \nothers cannot bring us peace. No leader is going to give us peace, no government, \nno army, no country. What will bring peace is inward transformation which will \nlead to outward action. Inward transformation is not isolation, is not a withdrawal \nfrom outward action. On the contrary, there can be right action only when there \nis right thinking and there is no right thinking when there is no self-knowledge. \nWithout knowing yourself, there is no peace. \nTo put an end to outward war, you must begin to put an end to war in \nyourself. Some of you will nod your heads and say, “I agree”, and go outside and \ndo exactly the same as you have been doing for the last ten or twenty years. Your \nagreement is merely verbal and has no significance, for the world’s miseries and \nwars are not going to be stopped by your casual assent. They will be stopped"

    "text": "1 1 .  O N  F E A R \n \nQuestion: How am I to get rid of fear, which influences all my activities? \n \nKrishnamurti: What do we mean by fear? Fear of what? There are various types \nof fear and we need not analyse every type. But we can see that fear comes into \nbeing when our comprehension of relationship is not complete. Relationship is \nnot only between people but between ourselves and nature, between ourselves \nand property, between ourselves and ideas; as long as that relationship is not \nfully understood, there must be fear. Life is relationship. To be is to be related \nand without relationship there is no life. Nothing can exist in isolation; so long as \nthe mind is seeking isolation, there must be fear. Fear is not an abstraction; it \nexists only in relation to something. \nThe question is, how to be rid of fear? First of all, anything that is overcome \nhas to be conquered again and again. No problem can be finally overcome, \nconquered; it can be understood but not conquered. They are two completely \ndifferent processes and the conquering process leads to further confusion, further \nfear. To resist, to dominate, to do battle with a problem or to build a defence \nagainst it is only to create further conflict, whereas if we can understand fear, go \ninto it fully step by step, explore the whole content of it, then fear will never \nreturn in any form. \nAs I said, fear is not an abstraction; it exists only in relationship. What do we \nmean by fear? Ultimately we are afraid, are we not?, of not being, of not \nbecoming. Now, when there is fear of not being, of not advancing, or fear of the \nunknown, of death, can that fear be overcome by determination, by a conclusion, \nby any choice? Obviously not. Mere suppression, sublimation, or substitution, \ncreates further resistance, does it not? Therefore fear can never be overcome \nthrough any form of discipline, through any form of resistance. That fact must be \nclearly seen, felt and experienced: fear cannot be overcome through any form of \ndefence or resistance nor can there be freedom from fear through the search for \nan answer or through mere intellectual or verbal explanation. \nNow what are we afraid of? Are we afraid of a fact or of an idea about the \nfact? Are we afraid of the thing as it is, or are we afraid of what we think it is? \nTake death, for example. Are we afraid of the fact of death or of the idea of \ndeath? The fact is one thing and the idea about the fact is another. Am I afraid of \nthe word ‘death’ or of the fact itself? Because I am afraid of the word, of the \nidea, I never understand the fact, I never look at the fact, I am never in direct \nrelation with the fact. It is only when I am in complete communion with the fact \nthat there is no fear. If I am not in communion with the fact, then there is fear, \nand there is no communion with the fact so long as I have an idea, an opinion, a \ntheory, about the fact, so I have to be very clear whether I am afraid of the word, \nthe idea or of the fact. If I am face to face with the fact, there is nothing to \nunderstand about it: the fact is there, and I can deal with it. If I am afraid of the \nword, then I must understand the word, go into the whole process of what the \nword, the term, implies."

    "text": "For example, one is afraid of loneliness, afraid of the ache, the pain of \nloneliness. Surely that fear exists because one has never really looked at \nloneliness, one has never been in complete communion with it. The moment one \nis completely open to the fact of loneliness one can understand what it is, but one \nhas an idea, an opinion about it, based on previous knowledge; it is this idea, \nopinion, this previous knowledge about the fact, that creates fear. Fear is \nobviously the outcome of naming, of terming, of projecting a symbol to represent \nthe fact; that is fear is not independent of the word, of the term. \nI have a reaction, say, to loneliness; that is I say I am afraid of being nothing. \nAm I afraid of the fact itself or is that fear awakened because I have previous \nknowledge of the fact, knowledge being the word, the symbol, the image? How \ncan there be fear of a fact? When I am face to face with a fact, in direct \ncommunion with it, I can look at it, observe it; therefore there is no fear of the \nfact. What causes fear is my apprehension about the fact, what the fact might be \nor do. \nIt is my opinion, my idea, my experience, my knowledge about the fact, that \ncreates fear. So long as there is verbalization of the fact, giving the fact a name \nand therefore identifying or condemning it, so long as thought is judging the fact \nas an observer, there must be fear. Thought is the product of the past, it can only \nexist through verbalization, through symbols, through images; so long as thought \nis regarding or translating the fact, there must be fear. \nThus it is the mind that creates fear, the mind being the process of thinking. \nThinking is verbalization. You cannot think without words, without symbols, \nimages; these images, which are the prejudices, the previous knowledge, the \napprehensions of the mind, are projected upon the fact, and out of that there \narises fear. There is freedom from fear only when the mind is capable of looking \nat the fact without translating it, without giving it a name, a label. This is quite \ndifficult, because the feelings, the reactions, the anxieties that we have, are \npromptly identified by the mind and given a word. The feeling of jealousy is \nidentified by that word. Is it possible not to identify a feeling, to look at that \nfeeling without naming it? It is the naming of the feeling that gives it continuity, \nthat gives it strength. The moment you give a name to that which you call fear, \nyou strengthen it; but if you can look at that feeling without terming it, you will \nsee that it withers away. Therefore if one would be completely free of fear it is \nessential to understand this whole process of terming, of projecting symbols, \nimages, giving names to facts. There can be freedom from fear only when there \nis self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, which is the \nending of fear."

Should I undertake some useful work? \n \nKrishnamurti: Become a social worker or a political worker or a religious \nworker—is that it? Because you have nothing else to do, therefore you become a \nreformer! If you have nothing to do, if you are bored, why not be bored? Why \nnot be that? If you are in sorrow, be sorrowful. Don’t try to find a way out of it, \nbecause your being bored has an immense significance, if you can understand it, \nlive with it. If you say, “I am bored, therefore I will do something else”, you are \nmerely trying to escape from boredom, and, as most of our activities are escapes, \nyou do much more harm socially and in every other way. The mischief is much \ngreater when you escape than when you are what you are and remain with it. The \ndifficulty is, how to remain with it and not run away; as most of our activities are \na process of escape it is immensely difficult for you to stop escaping and face it. \nTherefore I am glad if you are really bored and I say, “Full stop, let’s stay there, \nlet’s look at it. Why should you do anything?” \nIf you are bored, why are you bored? What is the thing called boredom? Why \nis it that you are not interested in anything? There must be reasons and causes \nwhich have made you dull: suffering, escapes, beliefs, incessant activity, have \nmade the mind dull, the heart unpliable. If you could find out why you are bored, \nwhy there is no interest, then surely you would solve the problem, wouldn’t you? \nThen the awakened interest will function. If you are not interested in why you are \nbored, you cannot force yourself to be interested in an activity, merely to be \ndoing something—like a squirrel going round in a cage. I know that this is the \nkind of activity most of us indulge in. But we can find out inwardly, \npsychologically, why we are in this state of utter boredom; we can see why most \nof us are in this state: we have exhausted ourselves emotionally and mentally; we \nhave tried so many things, so many sensations, so many amusements, so many \nexperiments, that we have become dull, weary. We join one group, do everything \nwanted of us and then leave it; we then go to something else and try that. If we \nfail with one psychologist, we go to somebody else or to the priest; if we fail \nthere, we go to another teacher, and so on; we always keep going. This process of \nconstantly stretching and letting go is exhausting, isn’t it? Like all sensations, it \nsoon dulls the mind. \nWe have done that, we have gone from sensation to sensation, from \nexcitement to excitement, till we come to a point when we are really exhausted. \nNow, realizing that, don’t proceed any further; take a rest. Be quiet. Let the mind \ngather strength by itself; don’t force it. As the soil renews itself during the winter \ntime, so, when the mind is allowed to be quiet, it renews itself. But it is very \ndifficult to allow the mind to be quiet, to let it lie fallow after all this, for the \nmind wants to be doing something all the time. When you come to that point \nwhere you are really allowing yourself to be as you are—bored, ugly, hideous, or \nwhatever it is—then there is a possibility of dealing with it."

If we \naccept what we are, then we see that the thing which we dreaded, the thing which \nwe called boredom, the thing which we called despair, the thing which we called \nfear, has undergone a complete change. There is a complete transformation of the \nthing of which we were afraid. \nThat is why it is important, as I said, to understand the process, the ways of \nour own thinking.

I understand \nintellectually that I am this resentment, this hatred; but I cannot cope with it. Can \nyou show me a way? \n \nKrishnamurti: What do we mean by ‘intellectually’? When we say that we \nunderstand something intellectually, what do we mean by that? Is there such a \nthing as intellectual understanding? Or is it that the mind merely understands the \nwords, because that is our only way of communicating with each other? Can we, \nhowever, really understand anything merely verbally, mentally? That is the first \nthing we have to be clear about: whether so-called intellectual understanding is \nnot an impediment to understanding. Surely understanding is integral, not \ndivided, not partial? Either I understand something or I don’t. To say to oneself, \n“I understand something intellectually”, is surely a barrier to understanding. It is \na partial process and therefore no understanding at all. \nNow the question is this: “How am I, who am resentful, hateful, how am I to \nbe free of, or cope with that problem?” How do we cope with a problem? What is \na problem? Surely, a problem is something which is disturbing. \nI am resentful, I am hateful; I hate people and it causes pain. And I am aware \nof it. What am I to do? It is a very disturbing factor in my life. What am I to do, \nhow am I to be really free of it—not just momentarily slough it off but \nfundamentally be free of it? How am I to do it? \nIt is a problem to me because it disturbs me. If it were not a disturbing thing, \nit would not be a problem to me, would it? Because it causes pain, disturbance, \nanxiety, because I think it is ugly, I want to get rid of it. Therefore the thing that I \nam objecting to is the disturbance, isn’t it? I give it different names at different \ntimes, in different moods; one day I call it this and another something else but the \ndesire is, basically, not to be disturbed. Isn’t that it? Because pleasure is not \ndisturbing, I accept it. I don’t want to be free from pleasure, because there is no \ndisturbance—at least, not for the time being, but hate, resentment, are very \ndisturbing factors in my life and I want to get rid of them. \nMy concern is not to be disturbed and I am trying to find a way in which I \nshall never be disturbed. Why should I not be disturbed? I must be disturbed, to \nfind out, must I not? I must go through tremendous upheavals, turmoil, anxiety, \nto find out, must I not? If I am not disturbed I shall remain asleep and perhaps \nthat is what most of us do want—to be pacified, to be put to sleep, to get away \nfrom any disturbance, to find isolation, seclusion, security. If I do not mind being \ndisturbed—really, not just superficially, if I don’t mind being disturbed, because \nI want to find out—then my attitude towards hate, towards resentment, undergoes \na change, doesn’t it? If I do not mind being disturbed, then the name is not \nimportant, is it? The word ‘hate’ is not important, is it? Or ‘resentment’ against \npeople is not important, is it?

You may be very \ngenerous in giving a large donation to your society, to your friends, but awfully \nmean about giving a bigger tip—you know what I mean by ‘mean’. One is \nunconscious of it. When one becomes aware of it, what happens? We exert our \nwill to be generous; we try to overcome it; we discipline ourselves to be generous \nand so on and so on. But, after all, the exertion of will to be something is still part \nof meanness in a larger circle, so if we do not do any of those things but are \nmerely aware of the implications of meanness, without giving it a term, then we \nwill see that there takes place a radical transformation. \nPlease experiment with this. First, one must be disturbed, and it is obvious \nthat most of us do not like to be disturbed. We think we have found a pattern of \nlife—the Master, the belief, whatever it is—and there we settle down. It is like \nhaving a good bureaucratic job and functioning there for the rest of one’s life. \nWith that same mentality we approach various qualities of which we want to be \nrid. We do not see the importance of being disturbed, of being inwardly insecure, \nof not being dependent. Surely it is only in insecurity that you discover, that you \nsee, that you understand? We want to be like a man with plenty of money, at \nease; he will not be disturbed; he doesn’t want to be disturbed. \nDisturbance is essential for understanding and any attempt to find security is \na hindrance to understanding. When we want to get rid of something which is \ndisturbing, it is surely a hindrance. If we can experience a feeling directly, \nwithout naming it, I think we shall find a great deal in it; then there is no longer a \nbattle with it, because the experiencer and the thing experienced are one, and that \nis essential. So long as the experiencer verbalizes the feeling, the experience, he \nseparates himself from it and acts upon it; such action is an artificial, illusory \naction. But if there is no verbalization, then the experiencer and the thing \nexperienced are one. That integration is necessary and has to be radically faced."

I do not \nshiver at the word ‘gossip’ just because it has been condemned for ages. \n \nKrishnamurti: I wonder why we gossip? Not because it reveals others to us. And \nwhy should others be revealed to us? Why do you want to know others? Why this \nextraordinary concern about others? First of all, why do we gossip? It is a form \nof restlessness, is it not? Like worry, it is an indication of a restless mind. Why \nthis desire to interfere with others, to know what others are doing, saying? It is a \nvery superficial mind that gossips, isn’t it?—an inquisitive mind which is \nwrongly directed. The questioner seems to think that others are revealed to him \nby his being concerned with them—with their doings, with their thoughts, with \ntheir opinions. But do we know others if we don’t know ourselves? Can we judge \nothers, if we do not know the way of our own thinking, the way we act, the way \nwe behave? Why this extraordinary concern over others? Is it not an escape, \nreally, this desire to find out what others are thinking and feeling and gossiping \nabout? Doesn’t it offer an escape from ourselves? Is there not in it also the desire \nto interfere with others’ lives? Isn’t our own life sufficiently difficult, sufficiently \ncomplex, sufficiently painful, without dealing with others’, interfering with \nothers’? Is there time to think about others in that gossipy, cruel, ugly manner? \nWhy do we do this? You know, everybody does it. Practically everybody gossips \nabout somebody else. Why? \nI think, first of all, we gossip about others because we are not sufficiently \ninterested in the process of our own thinking and of our own action. We want to \nsee what others are doing and perhaps, to put it kindly, to imitate others. \nGenerally, when we gossip it is to condemn others, but, stretching it charitably, it \nis perhaps to imitate others. Why do we want to imitate others? Doesn’t it all \nindicate an extraordinary shallowness on our own part? It is an extraordinarily \ndull mind that wants excitement, and goes outside itself to get it. In other words, \ngossip is a form of sensation, isn’t it?, in which we indulge. It may be a different \nkind of sensation, but there is always this desire to find excitement, distraction. If \none really goes into this question deeply, one comes back to oneself, which \nshows that one is really extraordinarily shallow and seeking excitement from \noutside by talking about others. Catch yourself the next time you are gossiping \nabout somebody; if you are aware of it, it will indicate an awful lot to you about \nyourself. Don’t cover it up by saying that you are merely inquisitive about others. \nIt indicates restlessness, a sense of excitement, a shallowness, a lack of real, \nprofound interest in people which has nothing to do with gossip. \nThe next problem is, how to stop gossip. That is the next question, isn’t it? \nWhen you are aware that you are gossiping, how do you stop gossiping? If it has \nbecome a habit, an ugly thing that continues day after day, how do you stop it? \nDoes that question arise? When you know you are gossiping, when you are \naware that you are gossiping, aware of all its implications, do you then say to \nyourself, “How am I to stop it?” Does it not stop of its own accord, the moment"

    "text": "you are aware that you are gossiping? The ‘how’ does not arise at all. The ‘how’ \narises only when you are unaware; and gossip indicates a lack of awareness. \nExperiment with this for yourself the next time you are gossiping, and see how \nquickly, how immediately you stop gossiping when you are aware of what you \nare talking about, aware that your tongue is running away with you. It does not \ndemand the action of will to stop it. All that is necessary is to be aware, to be \nconscious of what you are saying and to see the implications of it. You don’t \nhave to condemn or justify gossip. Be aware of it and you will see how quickly \nyou stop gossiping; because it reveals to oneself one’s own ways of action, one’s \nbehaviour, thought pattern; in that revelation, one discovers oneself, which is far \nmore important than gossiping about others, about what they are doing, what \nthey are thinking, how they behave. \nMost of us who read daily newspapers are filled with gossip, global gossip. It \nis all an escape from ourselves, from our own pettiness, from our own ugliness. \nWe think that through a superficial interest in world events we are becoming \nmore and more wise, more capable of dealing with our own lives. All these, \nsurely, are ways of escaping from ourselves, are they not? In ourselves we are so \nempty, shallow; we are so frightened of ourselves. We are so poor in ourselves \nthat gossip acts as a form of rich entertainment, an escape from ourselves. We try \nto fill that emptiness in us with knowledge, with rituals, with gossip, with group \nmeetings—with the innumerable ways of escape, so the escapes become all-\nimportant, and not the understanding of what is. The understanding of what is \ndemands attention; to know that one is empty, that one is in pain, needs immense \nattention and not escapes, but most of us like these escapes, because they are \nmuch more pleasurable, more pleasant. Also, when we know ourselves as we are, \nit is very difficult to deal with ourselves; that is one of the problems with which \nwe are faced. We don’t know what to do. When I know that I am empty, that I \nam suffering, that I am in pain, I don’t know what to do, how to deal with it. So \none resorts to all kinds of escapes. \nThe question is, what to do? Obviously, of course, one cannot escape; for that \nis most absurd and childish. But when you are faced with yourself as you are, \nwhat are you to do? First, is it possible not to deny or justify it but just to remain \nwith it, as you are?—which is extremely arduous, because the mind seeks \nexplanation, condemnation, identification. If it does not do any of those things \nbut remains with it, then it is like accepting something. If I accept that I am \nbrown, that is the end of it; but if I am desirous of changing to a lighter colour, \nthen the problem arises. To accept what is is most difficult; one can do that only \nwhen there is no escape and condemnation or justification is a form of escape. \nTherefore when one understands the whole process of why one gossips and when \none realizes the absurdity of it, the cruelty and all the things involved in it, then \none is left with what one is; and we approach it always either to destroy it, or to \nchange it into something else. If we don’t do either of those things but approach \nit with the intention of understanding it, being with it completely, then we will \nfind that it is no longer the thing that we dreaded. Then there is a possibility of \ntransforming that which is."

What is the difference \nbetween destructive and constructive criticism? \n \nKrishnamurti: First of all, why do we criticize? Is it in order to understand? Or is \nit merely a nagging process? If I criticize you, do I understand you? Does \nunderstanding come through judgement? If I want to comprehend, if I want to \nunderstand not superficially but deeply the whole significance of my relationship \nto you, do I begin to criticize you? Or am I aware of this relationship between \nyou and me, silently observing it—not projecting my opinions, criticisms, \njudgements, identifications or condemnations, but silently observing what is \nhappening? And if I do not criticize, what happens? One is apt to go to sleep, is \none not? Which does not mean that we do not go to sleep if we are nagging. \nPerhaps that becomes a habit and we put ourselves to sleep through habit. Is there \na deeper, wider understanding of relationship, through criticism? It doesn’t \nmatter whether criticism is constructive or destructive—that is irrelevant, surely. \nTherefore the question is: “What is the necessary state of mind and heart that will \nunderstand relationship?” What is the process of understanding? How do we \nunderstand something? How do you understand your child, if you are interested \nin your child? You observe, don’t you? You watch him at play, you study him in \nhis different moods; you don’t project your opinion on to him. You don’t say he \nshould be this or that. You are alertly watchful, aren’t you?, actively aware. \nThen, perhaps, you begin to understand the child. If you are constantly \ncriticizing, constantly injecting your own particular personality, your \nidiosyncrasies, your opinions, deciding the way he should or should not be, and \nall the rest of it, obviously you create a barrier in that relationship. Unfortunately \nmost of us criticize in order to shape, in order to interfere; it gives us a certain \namount of pleasure, a certain gratification, to shape something—the relationship \nwith a husband, child or whoever it may be. You feel a sense of power in it, you \nare the boss, and in that there is a tremendous gratification. Surely through all \nthat process there is no understanding of relationship. There is mere imposition, \nthe desire to mould another to the particular pattern of your idiosyncrasy, your \ndesire, your wish. All these prevent, do they not?, the understanding of \nrelationship. \nThen there is self-criticism. To be critical of oneself, to criticize, condemn, or \njustify oneself—does that bring understanding of oneself? When I begin to \ncriticize myself, do I not limit the process of understanding, of exploring? Does \nintrospection, a form of self-criticism, unfold the self? What makes the \nunfoldment of the self possible? To be constantly analytical, fearful, critical—\nsurely that does not help to unfold. What brings about the unfoldment of the self \nso that you begin to understand it is the constant awareness of it without any \ncondemnation, without any identification. There must be a certain spontaneity; \nyou cannot be constantly analysing it, disciplining it, shaping it. This spontaneity \nis essential to understanding. If I merely limit, control, condemn, then I put a stop \nto the movement of thought and feeling, do I not? It is in the movement of"

If I act according to an idea, \naccording to a standard, according to an ideal, then I force the self into a \nparticular pattern. In that there is no understanding, there is no transcending. If I \ncan watch the self without any condemnation, without any identification, then it \nis possible to go beyond it. That is why this whole process of approximating \noneself to an ideal is so utterly wrong. Ideals are home-made gods and to \nconform to a self-projected image is surely not a release. \nThus there can be understanding only when the mind is silently aware, \nobserving—which is arduous, because we take delight in being active, in being \nrestless, critical, in condemning, justifying. That is our whole structure of being; \nand, through the screen of ideas, prejudices, points of view, experiences, \nmemories, we try to understand. Is it possible to be free of all these screens and \nso understand directly? Surely we do that when the problem is very intense; we \ndo not go through all these methods—we approach it directly. The understanding \nof relationship comes only when this process of self-criticism is understood and \nthe mind is quiet. If you are listening to me and are trying to follow, with not too \ngreat an effort, what I wish to convey, then there is a possibility of our \nunderstanding each other. But if you are all the time criticizing, throwing up your \nopinions, what you have learned from books, what somebody else has told you \nand so on and so on, then you and I are not related, because this screen is \nbetween us. If we are both trying to find out the issues of the problem, which lie \nin the problem itself, if both of us are eager to go to the bottom of it, find the \ntruth of it, discover what it is—then we are related. Then your mind is both alert \nand passive, watching to see what is true in this. Therefore your mind must be \nextraordinarily swift, not anchored to any idea or ideal, to any judgement, to any \nopinion that you have consolidated through your particular experiences. \nUnderstanding comes, surely, when there is the swift pliability of a mind which \nis passively aware. Then it is capable of reception, then it is sensitive. A mind is \nnot sensitive when it is crowded with ideas, prejudices, opinions, either for or \nagainst. \nTo understand relationship, there must be a passive awareness—which does \nnot destroy relationship. On the contrary, it makes relationship much more vital, \nmuch more significant. Then there is in that relationship a possibility of real \naffection; there is a warmth, a sense of nearness, which is not mere sentiment or \nsensation. If we can so approach or be in that relationship to everything, then our \nproblems will be easily solved—the problems of property, the problems of \npossession, because we are that which we possess. The man who possesses \nmoney is the money. The man who identifies himself with property is the \nproperty or the house or the furniture. Similarly with ideas or with people; when \nthere is possessiveness, there is no relationship. Most of us possess because we \nhave nothing else if we do not possess. We are empty shells if we do not possess, \nif we do not fill our life with furniture, with music, with knowledge, with this or \nthat. And that shell makes a lot of noise and that noise we call living; and with \nthat we are satisfied.

Why do you not try to revive man’s faith in the idea of God? \n \nKrishnamurti: Let us look at the problem widely and intelligently. I am not \ndenying God—it would be foolish to do so. Only the man who does not know \nreality indulges in meaningless words. The man who says he knows, does not \nknow; the man who is experiencing reality from moment to moment has no \nmeans of communicating that reality. \nBelief is a denial of truth, belief hinders truth; to believe in God is not to find \nGod. Neither the believer nor the non-believer will find God; because reality is \nthe unknown, and your belief or non-belief in the unknown is merely a self-\nprojection and therefore not real. I know you believe and I know it has very little \nmeaning in your life. There are many people who believe; millions believe in \nGod and take consolation. First of all, why do you believe? You believe because \nit gives you satisfaction, consolation, hope, and you say it gives significance to \nlife. Actually your belief has very little significance, because you believe and \nexploit, you believe and kill, you believe in a universal God and murder each \nother. The rich man also believes in God; he exploits ruthlessly, accumulates \nmoney, and then builds a temple or becomes a philanthropist. \nThe men who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima said that God was with \nthem; those who flew from England to destroy Germany said that God was their \ncopilot. The dictators, the prime ministers, the generals, the presidents, all talk of \nGod, they have immense faith in God. Are they doing service, making a better \nlife for man? The people who say they believe in God have destroyed half the \nworld and the world is in complete misery. Through religious intolerance there \nare divisions of people as believers and non-believers, leading to religious wars. \nIt indicates how extraordinarily politically-minded you are. \nIs belief in God “a powerful incentive to better living”? Why do you want an \nincentive to better living? Surely, your incentive must be your own desire to live \ncleanly and simply, must it not? If you look to an incentive, you are not \ninterested in making life possible for all, you are merely interested in your \nincentive, which is different from mine—and we will quarrel over the incentive. \nIf we live happily together not because we believe in God but because we are \nhuman beings, then we will share the entire means of production in order to \nproduce things for all. Through lack of intelligence we accept the idea of a super-\nintelligence which we call ‘God’; but this ‘God’, this super-intelligence, is not \ngoing to give us a better life. What leads to a better life is intelligence; and there \ncannot be intelligence if there is belief, if there are class divisions, if the means of \nproduction are in the hands of a few, if there are isolated nationalities and \nsovereign governments. All this obviously indicates lack of intelligence and it is \nthe lack of intelligence that is preventing a better living, not non-belief in God. \nYou all believe in different ways, but your belief has no reality whatsoever. \nReality is what you are, what you do, what you think, and your belief in God is \nmerely an escape from your monotonous, stupid and cruel life.

Belief, idea, divides; it \nnever brings people together. You may bring a few people together in a group but \nthat group is opposed to another group. Ideas and beliefs are never unifying; on \nthe contrary, they are separative, disintegrating and destructive. Therefore your \nbelief in God is really spreading misery in the world; though it may have brought \nyou momentary consolation, in actuality it has brought you more misery and \ndestruction in the form of wars, famines, class divisions and the ruthless action of \nseparate individuals. So your belief has no validity at all. If you really believed in \nGod, if it were a real experience to you, then your face would have a smile; you \nwould not be destroying human beings. \nNow, what is reality, what is God? God is not the word, the word is not the \nthing. To know that which is immeasurable, which is not of time, the mind must \nbe free of time, which means the mind must be free from all thought, from all \nideas about God. What do you know about God or truth? You do not really know \nanything about that reality. All that you know are words, the experiences of \nothers or some moments of rather vague experience of your own. Surely that is \nnot God, that is not reality, that is not beyond the field of time. To know that \nwhich is beyond time, the process of time must be understood, time being \nthought, the process of becoming, the accumulation of knowledge. That is the \nwhole background of the mind; the mind itself is the background, both the \nconscious and the unconscious, the collective and the individual. So the mind \nmust be free of the known, which means the mind must be completely silent, not \nmade silent. The mind that achieves silence as a result, as the outcome of \ndetermined action, of practice, of discipline, is not a silent mind. The mind that is \nforced, controlled, shaped, put into a frame and kept quiet, is not a still mind. \nYou may succeed for a period of time in forcing the mind to be superficially \nsilent, but such a mind is not a still mind. Stillness comes only when you \nunderstand the whole process of thought, because to understand the process is to \nend it and the ending of the process of thought is the beginning of silence. \nOnly when the mind is completely silent not only on the upper level but \nfundamentally, right through, on both the superficial and the deeper levels of \nconsciousness—only then can the unknown come into being. The unknown is not \nsomething to be experienced by the mind; silence alone can be experienced, \nnothing but silence. If the mind experiences anything but silence, it is merely \nprojecting its own desires and such a mind is not silent; so long as the mind is not \nsilent, so long as thought in any form, conscious or unconscious, is in movement, \nthere can be no silence. Silence is freedom from the past, from knowledge, from \nboth conscious and unconscious memory; when the mind is completely silent, \nnot in use, when there is the silence which is not a product of effort, then only \ndoes the timeless, the eternal come into being. That state is not a state of \nremembering—there is no entity that remembers, that experiences. \nTherefore God or truth or what you will is a thing that comes into being from \nmoment to moment, and it happens only in a state of freedom and spontaneity, \nnot when the mind is disciplined according to a pattern.

In what sense is it an incomplete \nexperience? Please explain this idea in all its details. \n \nKrishnamurti: What do we mean by memory? You go to school and are full of \nfacts, technical knowledge. If you are an engineer, you use the memory of \ntechnical knowledge to build a bridge. That is factual memory. There is also \npsychological memory. You have said something to me, pleasant or unpleasant, \nand I retain it; when I next meet you, I meet you with that memory, the memory \nof what you have said or have not said. There are two facets to memory, the \npsychological and the factual. They are always interrelated, therefore not clear \ncut. We know that factual memory is essential as a means of livelihood but is \npsychological memory essential? What is the factor which retains the \npsychological memory? What makes one psychologically remember insult or \npraise? Why does one retain certain memories and reject others? Obviously one \nretains memories which are pleasant and avoids memories which are unpleasant. \nIf you observe, you will see that painful memories are put aside more quickly \nthan the pleasurable ones. Mind is memory, at whatever level, by whatever name \nyou call it; mind is the product of the past, it is founded on the past, which is \nmemory, a conditioned state. Now with that memory we meet life, we meet a \nnew challenge. The challenge is always new and our response is always old, \nbecause it is the outcome of the past. So experiencing without memory is one \nstate and experiencing with memory is another. That is there is a challenge, \nwhich is always new. I meet it with the response, with the conditioning of the \nold. So what happens? I absorb the new, I do not understand it; and the \nexperiencing of the new is conditioned by the past. Therefore there is a partial \nunderstanding of the new, there is never complete understanding. It is only when \nthere is complete understanding of anything that it does not leave the scar of \nmemory. \nWhen there is a challenge, which is ever new, you meet it with the response \nof the old. The old response conditions the new and therefore twists it, gives it a \nbias, therefore there is no complete understanding of the new so that the new is \nabsorbed into the old and accordingly strengthens the old. This may seem \nabstract but it is not difficult if you go into it a little closely and carefully. The \nsituation in the world at the present time demands a new approach, a new way of \ntackling the world problem, which is ever new. We are incapable of approaching \nit anew because we approach it with our conditioned minds, with national, local, \nfamily and religious prejudices. Our previous experiences are acting as a barrier \nto the understanding of the new challenge, so we go on cultivating and \nstrengthening memory and therefore we never understand the new, we never \nmeet the challenge fully, completely. It is only when one is able to meet the \nchallenge anew, afresh, without the past, only then does it yield its fruits, its \nriches."

    "text": "The questioner says, “I have a memory and a vivid impression of your \nprevious talks. In what sense is it an incomplete experience?” Obviously, it is an \nincomplete experience if it is merely an impression, a memory. If you understand \nwhat has been said, see the truth of it, that truth is not a memory. Truth is not a \nmemory, because truth is ever new, constantly transforming itself. You have a \nmemory of the previous talk. Why? Because you are using the previous talk as a \nguide, you have not fully understood it. You want to go into it and unconsciously \nor consciously it is being maintained. If you understand something completely, \nthat is see the truth of something wholly, you will find there is no memory \nwhatsoever. Our education is the cultivation of memory, the strengthening of \nmemory. Your religious practices and rituals, your reading and knowledge, are \nall the strengthening of memory. What do we mean by that? Why do we hold to \nmemory? I do not know if you have noticed that, as one grows older, one looks \nback to the past, to its joys, to its pains, to its pleasures; if one is young, one \nlooks to the future. Why are we doing this? Why has memory become so \nimportant? For the simple and obvious reason that we do not know how to live \nwholly, completely in the present. We are using the present as a means to the \nfuture and therefore the present has no significance. We cannot live in the present \nbecause we are using the present as a passage to the future. Because I am going \nto become something, there is never a complete understanding of myself, and to \nunderstand myself, what I am exactly now, does not require the cultivation of \nmemory. On the contrary, memory is a hindrance to the understanding of what is. \nI do not know if you have noticed that a new thought, a new feeling, comes only \nwhen the mind is not caught in the net of memory. When there is an interval \nbetween two thoughts, between two memories, when that interval can be \nmaintained, then out of that interval a new state of being comes which is no \nlonger memory. We have memories, and we cultivate memory as a means of \ncontinuance. The ‘me’ and the ‘mine’ becomes very important so long as the \ncultivation of memory exists, and as most of us are made up of ‘me’ and ‘mine’, \nmemory plays a very important part in our lives. If you had no memory, your \nproperty, your family, your ideas, would not be important as such; so to give \nstrength to ‘me’ and ‘mine’, you cultivate memory. If you observe, you will see \nthat there is an interval between two thoughts, between two emotions. In that \ninterval, which is not the product of memory, there is an extraordinary freedom \nfrom the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’ and that interval is timeless. \nLet us look at the problem differently. Surely memory is time, is it not? \nMemory creates yesterday, today and tomorrow. Memory of yesterday conditions \ntoday and therefore shapes tomorrow. That is the past through the present creates \nthe future. There is a time process going on, which is the will to become. \nMemory is time, and through time we hope to achieve a result. I am a clerk today \nand, given time and opportunity, I will become the manager or the owner. \nTherefore I must have time, and with the same mentality we say, “I shall achieve \nreality, I shall approach God”. Therefore I must have time to realize, which \nmeans I must cultivate memory, strengthen memory by practice, by discipline, to \nbe something, to achieve, to gain, which means continuation in time. Through \ntime we hope to achieve the timeless, through time we hope to gain the eternal."

Yesterday there was no memory, \nonly a spontaneous appreciation, a direct response; today you are desirous of \nrecapturing the experience of yesterday. That is, memory is intervening between \nyou and the sunset, therefore there is no enjoyment, there is no richness, fullness \nof beauty. Again, you have a friend, who said something to you yesterday, an \ninsult or a compliment and you retain that memory; with that memory you meet \nyour friend today. You do not really meet your friend—you carry with you the \nmemory of yesterday, which intervenes. So we go on, surrounding ourselves and \nour actions with memory, and therefore there is no newness, no freshness. That is \nwhy memory makes life weary, dull and empty. We live in antagonism with each \nother because the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’ are strengthened through memory. \nMemory comes to life through action in the present; we give life to memory \nthrough the present but when we do not give life to memory, it fades away. \nMemory of facts, of technical things, is an obvious necessity, but memory as \npsychological retention is detrimental to the understanding of life, the \ncommunion with each other."

S U R R E N D E R  T O  ‘ W H A T  I S ’ \n \nQuestion: What is the difference between surrendering to the will of God and \nwhat you are saying about the acceptance of what is? \n \nKrishnamurti: Surely there is a vast difference, is there not? Surrendering to the \nwill of God implies that you already know the will of God. You are not \nsurrendering to something you do not know. If you know reality, you cannot \nsurrender to it; you cease to exist; there is no surrendering to a higher will. If you \nare surrendering to a higher will, then that higher will is the projection of \nyourself, for the real cannot be known through the known. It comes into being \nonly when the known ceases to be. The known is a creation of the mind, because \nthought is the result of the known, of the past, and thought can only create what it \nknows; therefore what it knows is not the eternal. That is why, when you \nsurrender to the will of God, you are surrendering to your own projections; it \nmay be gratifying, comforting but it is not the real. \nTo understand what is demands a different process—perhaps the word \n‘process’ is not right but what I mean is this: to understand what is is much more \ndifficult, it requires greater intelligence, greater awareness, than merely to accept \nor give yourself over to an idea. To understand what is does not demand effort; \neffort is a distraction. To understand something, to understand what is you cannot \nbe distracted, can you? If I want to understand what you are saying I cannot \nlisten to music, to the noise of people outside, I must give my whole attention to \nit. Thus it is extraordinarily difficult and arduous to be aware of what is, because \nour very thinking has become a distraction. We do not want to understand what \nis. We look at what is through the spectacles of prejudice, of condemnation or of \nidentification, and it is very arduous to remove these spectacles and to look at \nwhat is. Surely what is is a fact, is the truth, and all else is an escape, is not the \ntruth. To understand what is, the conflict of duality must cease, because the \nnegative response of becoming something other than what is is the denial of the \nunderstanding of what is. If I want to understand arrogance I must not go into the \nopposite, I must not be distracted by the effort of becoming or even by the effort \nof trying to understand what is. If I am arrogant, what happens? If I do not name \narrogance, it ceases; which means that in the problem itself is the answer and not \naway from it. \nIt is not a question of accepting what is; you do not accept what is, you do not \naccept that you are brown or white, because it is a fact; only when you are trying \nto become something else do you have to accept. The moment you recognize a \nfact it ceases to have any significance; but a mind that is trained to think of the \npast or of the future, trained to run away in multifarious directions, such a mind \nis incapable of understanding what is. Without understanding what is you cannot \nfind what is real and without that understanding life has no significance, life is a \nconstant battle wherein pain and suffering continue. The real can only be \nunderstood by understanding what is. It cannot be understood if there is any \ncondemnation or identification. The mind that is always condemning or \nidentifying cannot understand; it can only understand that within which it is"

O N  P R A Y E R  A N D  M E D I T A T I O N \n \nQuestion: Is not the longing expressed in prayer a way to God? \n \nKrishnamurti: First of all, we are going to examine the problems contained in \nthis question. In it are implied prayer, concentration and meditation. Now what \ndo we mean by prayer? First of all, in prayer there is petition, supplication to \nwhat you call God, reality. You, as an individual, are demanding, petitioning, \nbegging, seeking guidance from something which you call God; therefore your \napproach is one of seeking a reward, seeking a gratification. You are in trouble, \nnational or individual, and you pray for guidance; or you are confused and you \nbeg for clarity, you look for help to what you call God. In this is implied that \nGod, whatever God may be—we won’t discuss that for the moment—is going to \nclear up the confusion which you and I have created. After all, it is we who have \nbrought about the confusion, the misery, the chaos, the appalling tyranny, the \nlack of love, and we want what we call God to clear it up. In other words, we \nwant our confusion, our misery, our sorrow, our conflict, to be cleared away by \nsomebody else, we petition another to bring us light and happiness. \nNow when you pray, when you beg, petition for something, it generally \ncomes into being. When you ask, you receive; but what you receive will not \ncreate order, because what you receive does not bring clarity, understanding. It \nonly satisfies, gives gratification but does not bring about understanding, \nbecause, when you demand, you receive that which you yourself project. How \ncan reality, God, answer your particular demand? Can the immeasurable, the \nunutterable, be concerned with our petty little worries, miseries, confusions, \nwhich we ourselves have created? Therefore what is it that answers? Obviously \nthe immeasurable cannot answer the measured, the petty, the small. But what is it \nthat answers? At the moment when we pray we are fairly silent, in a state of \nreceptivity; then our own subconscious brings a momentary clarity. You want \nsomething, you are longing for it, and in that moment of longing, of obsequious \nbegging, you are fairly receptive; your conscious, active mind is comparatively \nstill, so the unconscious projects itself into that and you have an answer. It is \nsurely not an answer from reality, from the immeasurable—it is your own \nunconscious responding. So don’t let us be confused and think that when your \nprayer is answered you are in relationship with reality. Reality must come to you; \nyou cannot go to it. \nIn this problem of prayer there is another factor involved: the response of that \nwhich we call the inner voice. As I said, when the mind is supplicating, \npetitioning, it is comparatively still; when you hear the inner voice, it is your own \nvoice projecting itself into that comparatively still mind. Again, how can it be the \nvoice of reality? A mind that is confused, ignorant, craving, demanding, \npetitioning, how can it understand reality? The mind can receive reality only \nwhen it is absolutely still, not demanding, not craving, not longing, not asking, \nwhether for yourself, for the nation or for another. When the mind is absolutely \nstill, when desire ceases, then only reality comes into being. A person who is \ndemanding, petitioning, supplicating, longing for direction will find what he"

What he receives will be the response of the \nunconscious layers of his own mind which project themselves into the conscious; \nthat still, small voice which directs him is not the real but only the response of \nthe unconscious. \nIn this problem of prayer there is also the question of concentration. With \nmost of us, concentration is a process of exclusion. Concentration is brought \nabout through effort, compulsion, direction, imitation, and so concentration is a \nprocess of exclusion. I am interested in so-called meditation but my thoughts are \ndistracted, so I fix my mind on a picture, an image, or an idea and exclude all \nother thoughts. This process of concentration, which is exclusion, is considered \nto be a means of meditating. That is what you do, is it not? When you sit down to \nmeditate, you fix your mind on a word, on an image, or on a picture but the mind \nwanders all over the place. There is the constant interruption of other ideas, other \nthoughts, other emotions and you try to push them away; you spend your time \nbattling with your thoughts. This process you call meditation. That is you are \ntrying to concentrate on something in which you are not interested and your \nthoughts keep on multiplying, increasing, interrupting, so you spend your energy \nin exclusion, in warding off, pushing away; if you can concentrate on your \nchosen thought, on a particular object, you think you have at last succeeded in \nmeditation. Surely that is not meditation, is it? Meditation is not an exclusive \nprocess—exclusive in the sense of warding off, building resistance against \nencroaching ideas. Prayer is not meditation and concentration as exclusion is not \nmeditation. \nWhat is meditation? Concentration is not meditation, because where there is \ninterest it is comparatively easy to concentrate on something. A general who is \nplanning war, butchery, is very concentrated. A businessman making money is \nvery concentrated—he may even be ruthless, putting aside every other feeling \nand concentrating completely on what he wants. A man who is interested in \nanything is naturally, spontaneously concentrated. Such concentration is not \nmeditation, it is merely exclusion. \nSo what is meditation? Surely meditation is understanding—meditation of the \nheart is understanding. How can there be understanding if there is exclusion? \nHow can there be understanding when there is petition, supplication? In \nunderstanding there is peace, there is freedom; that which you understand, from \nthat you are liberated. Merely to concentrate or to pray does not bring \nunderstanding. Understanding is the very basis, the fundamental process of \nmeditation. You don’t have to accept my word for it but if you examine prayer \nand concentration very carefully, deeply, you will find that neither of them leads \nto understanding. They merely lead to obstinacy, to a fixation, to illusion. \nWhereas meditation, in which there is understanding, brings about freedom, \nclarity and integration. \nWhat, then, do we mean by understanding? Understanding means giving right \nsignificance, right valuation, to all things. To be ignorant is to give wrong values; \nthe very nature of stupidity is the lack of comprehension of right values. \nUnderstanding comes into being when there are right values, when right values \nare established.

If I \ndon’t understand the thinker, which is myself, what I choose has no meaning; \nthat is if I don’t know myself, then my action, my thought, has no foundation \nwhatsoever. Therefore self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation—not the \nknowledge that you pick up from my books, from authorities, from gurus, but the \nknowledge that comes into being through self-inquiry, which is self-awareness. \nMeditation is the beginning of self-knowledge and without self-knowledge there \nis no meditation. If I don’t understand the ways of my thoughts, of my feelings, if \nI don’t understand my motives, my desires, my demands, my pursuit of patterns \nof action, which are ideas—if I do not know myself, there is no foundation for \nthinking; the thinker who merely asks, prays, or excludes, without understanding \nhimself, must inevitably end in confusion, in illusion. \nThe beginning of meditation is self-knowledge, which means being aware of \nevery movement of thought and feeling, knowing all the layers of my \nconsciousness, not only the superficial layers but the hidden, the deeply \nconcealed activities. To know the deeply concealed activities, the hidden \nmotives, responses, thoughts and feelings, there must be tranquillity in the \nconscious mind; that is the conscious mind must be still in order to receive the \nprojection of the unconscious. The superficial, conscious mind is occupied with \nits daily activities, with earning a livelihood, deceiving others, exploiting others, \nrunning away from problems—all the daily activities of our existence. That \nsuperficial mind must understand the right significance of its own activities and \nthereby bring tranquillity to itself. It cannot bring about tranquillity, stillness, by \nmere regimentation, by compulsion, by discipline. It can bring about tranquillity, \npeace, stillness, only by understanding its own activities, by observing them, by \nbeing aware of them, by seeing its own ruthlessness, how it talks to the servant, \nto the wife, to the daughter, to the mother and so on. When the superficial, \nconscious mind is thus fully aware of all its activities, through that understanding \nit becomes spontaneously quiet, not drugged by compulsion or regimented by \ndesire; then it is in a position to receive the intimation, the hints of the \nunconscious, of the many, many hidden layers of the mind—the racial instincts, \nthe buried memories, the concealed pursuits, the deep wounds that are still \nunhealed. It is only when all these have projected themselves and are understood, \nwhen the whole consciousness is unburdened, unfettered by any wound, by any \nmemory whatsoever, that it is in a position to receive the eternal. \nMeditation is self-knowledge and without self-knowledge there is no \nmeditation. If you are not aware of all your responses all the time, if you are not \nfully conscious, fully cognizant of your daily activities, merely to lock yourself \nin a room and sit down in front of a picture of your guru, of your Master, to \nmeditate, is an escape, because without self-knowledge there is no right thinking \nand, without right thinking, what you do has no meaning, however noble your \nintentions are. Thus prayer has no significance without self-knowledge but when \nthere is self-knowledge there is right thinking and hence right action. When there \nis right action, there is no confusion and therefore there is no supplication to \nsomeone else to lead you out of it. A man who is fully aware is meditating; he"

O N  T H E  C O N S C I O U S  A N D  U N C O N S C I O U S  M I N D \n \nQuestion: The conscious mind is ignorant and afraid of the unconscious mind. \nYou are addressing mainly the conscious mind and is that enough? Will your \nmethod bring about release of the unconscious? Please explain in detail how one \ncan tackle the unconscious mind fully. \n \nKrishnamurti: We are aware that there is the conscious and the unconscious \nmind but most of us function only on the conscious level, in the upper layer of \nthe mind, and our whole life is practically limited to that. We live in the so-called \nconscious mind and we never pay attention to the deeper unconscious mind from \nwhich there is occasionally an intimation, a hint; that hint is disregarded, \nperverted or translated according to our particular conscious demands at the \nmoment. Now the questioner asks, “You are addressing mainly the conscious \nmind and is that enough?” Let us see what we mean by the conscious mind. Is the \nconscious mind different from the unconscious mind? We have divided the \nconscious from the unconscious; is this justified? Is this true? Is there such a \ndivision between the conscious and the unconscious? Is there a definite barrier, a \nline where the conscious ends and the unconscious begins? We are aware that the \nupper layer, the conscious mind, is active but is that the only instrument that is \nactive throughout the day? If I were addressing merely the upper layer of the \nmind, then surely what I am saying would be valueless, it would have no \nmeaning. Yet most of us cling to what the conscious mind has accepted, because \nthe conscious mind finds it convenient to adjust to certain obvious facts; but the \nunconscious may rebel, and often does, and so there is conflict between the so-\ncalled conscious and the unconscious. \nTherefore, our problem is this, is it not? There is in fact only one state, not \ntwo states such as the conscious and the unconscious; there is only a state of \nbeing, which is consciousness, though you may divide it as the conscious and the \nunconscious. But that consciousness is always of the past, never of the present; \nyou are conscious only of things that are over. You are conscious of what I am \ntrying to convey the second afterwards, are you not?; you understand it a moment \nlater. You are never conscious or aware of the now. Watch your own hearts and \nminds and you will see that consciousness is functioning between the past and \nthe future and that the present is merely a passage of the past to the future. \nConsciousness is therefore a movement of the past to the future. \nIf you watch your own mind at work, you will see that the movement to the \npast and to the future is a process in which the present is not. Either the past is a \nmeans of escape from the present, which may be unpleasant, or the future is a \nhope away from the present. So the mind is occupied with the past or with the \nfuture and sloughs off the present. That is the mind is conditioned by the past, \nconditioned as an Indian, a Brahmin or a non-Brahmin, a Christian, a Buddhist \nand so on, and that conditioned mind projects itself into the future; therefore it is \nnever capable of looking directly and impartially at any fact. It either condemns \nand rejects the fact or accepts and identifies itself with the fact. Such a mind is \nobviously not capable of seeing any fact as a fact. That is our state of"

That strengthening of the past is obviously the continuity of itself, which \nit calls the future. So that is the state of our mind, of our consciousness—a \npendulum swinging backwards and forwards between the past and the future. \nThat is our consciousness, which is made up not only of the upper layers of the \nmind but of the deeper layers as well. Such consciousness obviously cannot \nfunction at a different level, because it only knows those two movements of \nbackwards and forwards. \nIf you watch very carefully you will see that it is not a constant movement but \nthat there is an interval between two thoughts; though it may be but an \ninfinitesimal fraction of a second, there is an interval that has significance in the \nswinging backwards and forwards of the pendulum. We see the fact that our \nthinking is conditioned by the past which is projected into the future; the moment \nyou admit the past, you must also admit the future, because there are not two \nsuch states as the past and the future but one state which includes both the \nconscious and the unconscious, both the collective past and the individual past. \nThe collective and the individual past, in response to the present, give out certain \nresponses which create the individual consciousness; therefore consciousness is \nof the past and that is the whole background of our existence. The moment you \nhave the past, you inevitably have the future, because the future is merely the \ncontinuity of the modified past but it is still the past, so our problem is how to \nbring about a transformation in this process of the past without creating another \nconditioning, another past. \nTo put it differently, the problem is this: Most of us reject one particular form \nof conditioning and find another form, a wider, more significant or more pleasant \nconditioning. You give up one religion and take on another, reject one form of \nbelief and accept another. Such substitution is obviously not understanding life, \nlife being relationship. Our problem is how to be free from all conditioning. \nEither you say it is impossible, that no human mind can ever be free from \nconditioning, or you begin to experiment, to inquire, to discover. If you assert \nthat it is impossible, obviously you are out of the running. Your assertion may be \nbased on limited or wide experience or on the mere acceptance of a belief but \nsuch assertion is the denial of search, of research, of inquiry, of discovery. To \nfind out if it is possible for the mind to be completely free from all conditioning, \nyou must be free to inquire and to discover. \nNow I say it is definitely possible for the mind to be free from all \nconditioning—not that you should accept my authority. If you accept it on \nauthority, you will never discover, it will be another substitution and that will \nhave no significance. When I say it is possible, I say it because for me it is a fact \nand I can show it to you verbally, but if you are to find the truth of it for yourself, \nyou must experiment with it and follow it swiftly. \nThe understanding of the whole process of conditioning does not come to you \nthrough analysis or introspection, because the moment you have the analyser that \nvery analyser himself is part of the background and therefore his analysis is of no"

The analyser who examines, \nwho analyses the thing which he is looking at, is himself part of the conditioned \nstate and therefore whatever his interpretation, his understanding, his analysis \nmay be, it is still part of the background. So that way there is no escape and to \nbreak the background is essential, because to meet the challenge of the new, the \nmind must be new; to discover God, truth, or what you will, the mind must be \nfresh, uncontaminated by the past. To analyse the past, to arrive at conclusions \nthrough a series of experiments, to make assertions and denials and all the rest of \nit, implies, in its very essence, the continuance of the background in different \nforms; when you see the truth of that fact you will discover that the analyser has \ncome to an end. Then there is no entity apart from the background: there is only \nthought as the background, thought being the response of memory, both \nconscious and unconscious, individual and collective. \nThe mind is the result of the past, which is the process of conditioning. How \nis it possible for the mind to be free? To be free, the mind must not only see and \nunderstand its pendulum-like swing between the past and the future but also be \naware of the interval between thoughts. That interval is spontaneous, it is not \nbrought about through any causation, through any wish, through any compulsion. \nIf you watch very carefully, you will see that though the response, the \nmovement of thought, seems so swift, there are gaps, there are intervals between \nthoughts. Between two thoughts there is a period of silence which is not related \nto the thought process. If you observe you will see that that period of silence, that \ninterval, is not of time and the discovery of that interval, the full experiencing of \nthat interval, liberates you from conditioning—or rather it does not liberate ‘you’ \nbut there is liberation from conditioning. So the understanding of the process of \nthinking is meditation. We are now not only discussing the structure and the \nprocess of thought, which is the background of memory, of experience, of \nknowledge, but we are also trying to find out if the mind can liberate itself from \nthe background. It is only when the mind is not giving continuity to thought, \nwhen it is still with a stillness that is not induced, that is without any causation—\nit is only then that there can be freedom from the background."

We \nhave made God a problem, we have made love a problem, we have made \nrelationship, living a problem, and we have made sex a problem. Why? Why is \neverything we do a problem, a horror? Why are we suffering? Why has sex \nbecome a problem? Why do we submit to living with problems, why do we not \nput an end to them? Why do we not die to our problems instead of carrying them \nday after day, year after year? Sex is certainly a relevant question but there is the \nprimary question, why do we make life into a problem? Working, sex, earning \nmoney, thinking, feeling, experiencing—you know, the whole business of \nliving—why is it a problem? Is it not essentially because we always think from a \nparticular point of view, from a fixed point of view? We are always thinking \nfrom a centre towards the periphery but the periphery is the centre for most of us \nand so anything we touch is superficial. But life is not superficial; it demands \nliving completely and because we are living only superficially we know only \nsuperficial reaction. Whatever we do on the periphery must inevitably create a \nproblem, and that is our life: we live in the superficial and we are content to live \nthere with all the problems of the superficial. Problems exist so long as we live in \nthe superficial, on the periphery, the periphery being the ‘me’ and its sensations, \nwhich can be externalized or made subjective, which can be identified with the \nuniverse, with the country or with some other thing made up by the mind. \nSo long as we live within the field of the mind there must be complications, \nthere must be problems; that is all we know. Mind is sensation, mind is the result \nof accumulated sensations and reactions and anything it touches is bound to \ncreate misery, confusion, an endless problem. The mind is the real cause of our \nproblems, the mind that is working mechanically night and day, consciously and \nunconsciously. The mind is a most superficial thing and we have spent \ngenerations, we spend our whole lives, cultivating the mind, making it more and \nmore clever, more and more subtle, more and more cunning, more and more \ndishonest and crooked, all of which is apparent in every activity of our life. The \nvery nature of our mind is to be dishonest, crooked, incapable of facing facts, and \nthat is the thing which creates problems; that is the thing which is the problem \nitself. \nWhat do we mean by the problem of sex? Is it the act, or is it a thought about \nthe act? Surely it is not the act. The sexual act is no problem to you, any more \nthan eating is a problem to you, but if you think about eating or anything else all \nday long because you have nothing else to think about, it becomes a problem to \nyou. Is the sexual act the problem or is it the thought about the act? Why do you \nthink about it? Why do you build it up, which you are obviously doing?

Because that is a way of ultimate escape, is it not? It is a way of \ncomplete self-forgetfulness. For the time being, at least for that moment, you can \nforget yourself—and there is no other way of forgetting yourself. Everything else \nyou do in life gives emphasis to the ‘me’, to the self. Your business, your \nreligion, your gods, your leaders, your political and economic actions, your \nescapes, your social activities, your joining one party and rejecting another—all \nthat is emphasizing and giving strength to the ‘me’. That is there is only one act \nin which there is no emphasis on the ‘me’, so it becomes a problem, does it not? \nWhen there is only one thing in your life which is an avenue to ultimate escape, \nto complete forgetfulness of yourself if only for a few seconds, you cling to it \nbecause that is the only moment in which you are happy. Every other issue you \ntouch becomes a nightmare, a source of suffering and pain, so you cling to the \none thing which gives complete self-forgetfulness, which you call happiness. But \nwhen you cling to it, it too becomes a nightmare, because then you want to be \nfree from it, you do not want to be a slave to it. So you invent, again from the \nmind, the idea of chastity, of celibacy, and you try to be celibate, to be chaste, \nthrough suppression, all of which are operations of the mind to cut itself off from \nthe fact. This again gives particular emphasis to the ‘me’ who is trying to become \nsomething, so again you are caught in travail, in trouble, in effort, in pain. \nSex becomes an extraordinarily difficult and complex problem so long as you \ndo not understand the mind which thinks about the problem. The act itself can \nnever be a problem but the thought about the act creates the problem. The act you \nsafeguard; you live loosely, or indulge yourself in marriage, thereby making your \nwife into a prostitute which is all apparently very respectable, and you are \nsatisfied to leave it at that. Surely the problem can be solved only when you \nunderstand the whole process and structure of the ‘me’ and the ‘mine’: my wife, \nmy child, my property, my car, my achievement, my success; until you \nunderstand and resolve all that, sex as a problem will remain. So long as you are \nambitious, politically, religiously or in any way, so long as you are emphasizing \nthe self, the thinker, the experiencer, by feeding him on ambition whether in the \nname of yourself as an individual or in the name of the country, of the party or of \nan idea which you call religion—so long as there is this activity of self-\nexpansion, you will have a sexual problem. You are creating, feeding, expanding \nyourself on the one hand, and on the other you are trying to forget yourself, to \nlose yourself if only for a moment. How can the two exist together? Your life is a \ncontradiction; emphasis on the ‘me’ and forgetting the ‘me’. Sex is not a \nproblem; the problem is this contradiction in your life; and the contradiction \ncannot be bridged over by the mind, because the mind itself is a contradiction. \nThe contradiction can be understood only when you understand fully the whole \nprocess of your daily existence.

    "text": "emphasize the self and at the same time you try to be kind, loving, tender. The \ntwo cannot go together. The man who is ambitious, spiritually or otherwise, can \nnever be without a problem, because problems cease only when the self is \nforgotten, when the ‘me’ is non-existent, and that state of the non-existence of \nthe self is not an act of will, it is not a mere reaction. Sex becomes a reaction; \nwhen the mind tries to solve the problem, it only makes the problem more \nconfused, more troublesome, more painful. The act is not the problem but the \nmind is the problem, the mind which says it must be chaste. Chastity is not of the \nmind. The mind can only suppress its own activities and suppression is not \nchastity. Chastity is not a virtue, chastity cannot be cultivated. The man who is \ncultivating humility is surely not a humble man; he may call his pride humility, \nbut he is a proud man, and that is why he seeks to become humble. Pride can \nnever become humble and chastity is not a thing of the mind—you cannot \nbecome chaste. You will know chastity only when there is love, and love is not \nof the mind nor a thing of the mind. \nTherefore the problem of sex which tortures so many people all over the \nworld cannot be resolved till the mind is understood. We cannot put an end to \nthinking but thought comes to an end when the thinker ceases and the thinker \nceases only when there is an understanding of the whole process. Fear comes into \nbeing when there is division between the thinker and his thought; when there is \nno thinker, then only is there no conflict in thought. What is implicit needs no \neffort to understand. The thinker comes into being through thought; then the \nthinker exerts himself to shape, to control his thoughts or to put an end to them. \nThe thinker is a fictitious entity, an illusion of the mind. When there is a \nrealization of thought as a fact, then there is no need to think about the fact. If \nthere is simple, choiceless awareness, then that which is implicit in the fact \nbegins to reveal itself. Therefore thought as fact ends. Then you will see that the \nproblems which are eating at our hearts and minds, the problems of our social \nstructure, can be resolved. Then sex is no longer a problem, it has its proper \nplace, it is neither an impure thing nor a pure thing. Sex has its place; but when \nthe mind gives it the predominant place, then it becomes a problem. The mind \ngives sex a predominant place because it cannot live without some happiness and \nso sex becomes a problem; when the mind understands its whole process and so \ncomes to an end, that is when thinking ceases, then there is creation and it is that \ncreation which makes us happy. To be in that state of creation is bliss, because it \nis self-forgetfulness in which there is no reaction as from the self. This is not an \nabstract answer to the daily problem of sex—it is the only answer. The mind \ndenies love and without love there is no chastity; it is because there is no love \nthat you make sex into a problem."

O N  L O V E \n \nQuestion: What do you mean by love? \n \nKrishnamurti: We are going to discover by understanding what love is not, \nbecause, as love is the unknown, we must come to it by discarding the known. \nThe unknown cannot be discovered by a mind that is full of the known. What we \nare going to do is to find out the values of the known, look at the known, and \nwhen that is looked at purely, without condemnation, the mind becomes free \nfrom the known; then we shall know what love is. So, we must approach love \nnegatively, not positively. \nWhat is love with most of us? When we say we love somebody, what do we \nmean? We mean we possess that person. From that possession arises jealousy, \nbecause if I lose him or her what happens? I feel empty, lost; therefore I legalize \npossession; I hold him or her. From holding, possessing that person, there is \njealousy, there is fear and all the innumerable conflicts that arise from \npossession. Surely such possession is not love, is it? \nObviously love is not sentiment. To be sentimental, to be emotional, is not \nlove, because sentimentality and emotion are mere sensations. A religious person \nwho weeps about Jesus or Krishna, about his guru or somebody else, is merely \nsentimental, emotional. He is indulging in sensation, which is a process of \nthought, and thought is not love. Thought is the result of sensation, so the person \nwho is sentimental, who is emotional, cannot possibly know love. Again, aren’t \nwe emotional and sentimental? Sentimentality, emotionalism, is merely a form of \nself-expansion. To be full of emotion is obviously not love, because a \nsentimental person can be cruel when his sentiments are not responded to, when \nhis feelings have no outlet. An emotional person can be stirred to hatred, to war, \nto butchery. A man who is sentimental, full of tears for his religion, surely has no \nlove. \nIs forgiveness love? What is implied in forgiveness? You insult me and I \nresent it, remember it; then, either through compulsion or through repentance, I \nsay, “I forgive you”. First I retain and then I reject. Which means what? I am still \nthe central figure. I am still important, it is I who am forgiving somebody. As \nlong as there is the attitude of forgiving it is I who am important, not the man \nwho is supposed to have insulted me. So when I accumulate resentment and then \ndeny that resentment, which you call forgiveness, it is not love. A man who loves \nobviously has no enmity and to all these things he is indifferent. Sympathy, \nforgiveness, the relationship of possessiveness, jealousy and fear—all these \nthings are not love. They are all of the mind, are they not? As long as the mind is \nthe arbiter, there is no love, for the mind arbitrates only through possessiveness \nand its arbitration is merely possessiveness in different forms. The mind can only \ncorrupt love, it cannot give birth to love, it cannot give beauty. You can write a \npoem about love, but that is not love. \nObviously there is no love when there is no real respect, when you don’t \nrespect another, whether he is your servant or your friend. Have you not noticed \nthat you are not respectful, kindly, generous, to your servants, to people who are"

You have respect for those above, for your boss, for the \nmillionaire, for the man with a large house and a title, for the man who can give \nyou a better position, a better job, from whom you can get something. But you \nkick those below you, you have a special language for them. Therefore where \nthere is no respect, there is no love; where there is no mercy, no pity, no \nforgiveness, there is no love. And as most of us are in this state we have no love. \nWe are neither respectful nor merciful nor generous. We are possessive, full of \nsentiment and emotion which can be turned either way: to kill, to butcher or to \nunify over some foolish, ignorant intention. So how can there be love? \nYou can know love only when all these things have stopped, come to an end, \nonly when you don’t possess, when you are not merely emotional with devotion \nto an object. Such devotion is a supplication, seeking something in a different \nform. A man who prays does not know love. Since you are possessive, since you \nseek an end, a result, through devotion, through prayer, which makes you \nsentimental, emotional, naturally there is no love; obviously there is no love \nwhen there is no respect. You may say that you have respect but your respect is \nfor the superior, it is merely the respect that comes from wanting something, the \nrespect of fear. If you really felt respect, you would be respectful to the lowest as \nwell as to the so-called highest; since you haven’t that, there is no love. How few \nof us are generous, forgiving, merciful! You are generous when it pays you, you \nare merciful when you can see something in return. When these things disappear, \nwhen these things don’t occupy your mind and when the things of the mind don’t \nfill your heart, then there is love; and love alone can transform the present \nmadness and insanity in the world—not systems, not theories, either of the left or \nof the right. You really love only when you do not possess, when you are not \nenvious, not greedy, when you are respectful, when you have mercy and \ncompassion, when you have consideration for your wife, your children, your \nneighbour, your unfortunate servants. \nLove cannot be thought about, love cannot be cultivated, love cannot be \npractised. The practice of love, the practice of brotherhood, is still within the \nfield of the mind, therefore it is not love. When all this has stopped, then love \ncomes into being, then you will know what it is to love. Then love is not \nquantitative but qualitative. You do not say, “I love the whole world” but when \nyou know how to love one, you know how to love the whole. Because we do not \nknow how to love one, our love of humanity is fictitious. When you love, there is \nneither one nor many: there is only love. It is only when there is love that all our \nproblems can be solved and then we shall know its bliss and its happiness."

Why do we regard \ndeath as something apart from life? Why are we afraid of death? And why have \nso many books been written about death? Why is there this line of demarcation \nbetween life and death? And is that separation real, or merely arbitrary, a thing of \nthe mind? \nWhen we talk about life, we mean living as a process of continuity in which \nthere is identification. Me and my house, me and my wife, me and my bank \naccount, me and my past experiences—that is what we mean by life, is it not? \nLiving is a process of continuity in memory, conscious as well as unconscious, \nwith its various struggles, quarrels, incidents, experiences and so on. All that is \nwhat we call life; in opposition to that there is death, which is putting an end to \nall that. Having created the opposite, which is death, and being afraid of it, we \nproceed to look for the relationship between life and death; if we can bridge the \ngap with some explanation, with belief in continuity, in the hereafter, we are \nsatisfied. We believe in reincarnation or in some other form of continuity of \nthought and then we try to establish a relationship between the known and the \nunknown. We try to bridge the known and the unknown and thereby try to find \nthe relationship between the past and the future. That is what we are doing, is it \nnot?, when we inquire if there is any relationship between life and death. We \nwant to know how to bridge the living and the ending—that is our fundamental \ndesire. \nNow, can the end, which is death, be known while living? If we can know \nwhat death is while we are living, then we shall have no problem. It is because \nwe cannot experience the unknown while we are living that we are afraid of it. \nOur struggle is to establish a relationship between ourselves, which is the result \nof the known, and the unknown which we call death. Can there be a relationship \nbetween the past and something which the mind cannot conceive, which we call \ndeath? Why do we separate the two? Is it not because our mind can function only \nwithin the field of the known, within the field of the continuous? One only knows \noneself as a thinker, as an actor with certain memories of misery, of pleasure, of \nlove, affection, of various kinds of experience; one only knows oneself as being \ncontinuous—otherwise one would have no recollection of oneself as being \nsomething. Now when that something comes to the end, which we call death, \nthere is fear of the unknown; so we want to draw the unknown into the known \nand our whole effort is to give continuity to the unknown. That is, we do not \nwant to know life, which includes death, but we want to know how to continue \nand not come to an end. We do not want to know life and death, we only want to \nknow how to continue without ending. \nThat which continues has no renewal. There can be nothing new, there can be \nnothing creative, in that which has continuance—which is fairly obvious. It is \nonly when continuity ends that there is a possibility of that which is ever new. \nBut it is this ending that we dread and we don’t see that only in ending can there"

Only in ending, in dying, can \nthe new be known; and the man who seeks to find a relationship between life and \ndeath, to bridge the continuous with that which he thinks is beyond, is living in a \nfictitious, unreal world, which is a projection of himself. \nNow is it possible, while living, to die—which means coming to an end, \nbeing as nothing?

    "text": "2 4 .  O N  T I M E \n \nQuestion: Can the past dissolve all at once, or does it invariably need time? \n \nKrishnamurti: We are the result of the past. Our thought is founded upon \nyesterday and many thousand yesterdays. We are the result of time, and our \nresponses, our present attitudes, are the cumulative effect of many thousand \nmoments, incidents and experiences. So the past is, for the majority of us, the \npresent, which is a fact which cannot be denied. You, your thoughts, your \nactions, your responses, are the result of the past. Now the questioner wants to \nknow if that past can be wiped out immediately, which means not in time but \nimmediately wiped out; or does this cumulative past require time for the mind to \nbe freed in the present? It is important to understand the question, which is this: \nAs each one of us is the result of the past, with a background of innumerable \ninfluences, constantly varying, constantly changing, is it possible to wipe out that \nbackground without going through the process of time? \nWhat is the past? What do we mean by the past? Surely we do not mean the \nchronological past. We mean, surely, the accumulated experiences, the \naccumulated responses, memories, traditions, knowledge, the subconscious \nstorehouse of innumerable thoughts, feelings, influences and responses. With that \nbackground, it is not possible to understand reality, because reality must be of no \ntime: it is timeless. So one cannot understand the timeless with a mind which is \nthe outcome of time. The questioner wants to know if it is possible to free the \nmind, or for the mind, which is the result of time, to cease to be immediately; or \nmust one go through a long series of examinations and analyses and so free the \nmind from its background. \nThe mind is the background; the mind is the result of time; the mind is the \npast, the mind is not the future. It can project itself into the future and the mind \nuses the present as a passage into the future, so it is still—whatever it does, \nwhatever its activity, its future activity, its present activity, its past activity—in \nthe net of time. Is it possible for the mind to cease completely, for the thought \nprocess to come to an end? Now there are obviously many layers to the mind; \nwhat we call consciousness has many layers, each layer interrelated with the \nother layer, each layer dependent on the other, interacting; our whole \nconsciousness is not only experiencing but also naming or terming and storing up \nas memory. That is the whole process of consciousness, is it not? \nWhen we talk about consciousness, do we not mean the experiencing, the \nnaming or the terming of that experience and thereby storing up that experience \nin memory? All this, at different levels, is consciousness. Can the mind, which is \nthe result of time, go through the process of analysis, step by step, in order to free \nitself from the background or is it possible to be free entirely from time and look \nat reality directly? \nTo be free of the background, many of the analysts say that you must examine \nevery response, every complex, every hindrance, every blockage, which \nobviously implies a process of time. This means the analyser must understand \nwhat he is analysing and he must not misinterpret what he analyses. If he"

The analyser must be capable of \nanalysing his thoughts and feelings without the slightest deviation; and he must \nnot miss one step in his analysis, because to take a wrong step, to draw a wrong \nconclusion, is to re-establish a background along a different line, on a different \nlevel. This problem also arises: Is the analyser different from what he analyses? \nAre not the analyser and the thing that is analysed a joint phenomenon? \nSurely the experiencer and the experience are a joint phenomenon; they are \nnot two separate processes, so first of all let us see the difficulty of analysing. It \nis almost impossible to analyse the whole content of our consciousness and \nthereby be free through that process. After all, who is the analyser? The analyser \nis not different, though he may think he is different, from that which he is \nanalysing. He may separate himself from that which he analyses but the analyser \nis part of that which he analyses. I have a thought, I have a feeling—say, for \nexample, I am angry. The person who analyses anger is still part of anger and \ntherefore the analyser as well as the analysed are a joint phenomenon, they are \nnot two separate forces or processes. So the difficulty of analysing ourselves, \nunfolding, looking at ourselves page after page, watching every reaction, every \nresponse, is incalculably difficult and long. Therefore that is not the way to free \nourselves from the background, is it? There must be a much simpler, a more \ndirect way, and that is what you and I are going to find out. In order to find out \nwe must discard that which is false and not hold on to it. So analysis is not the \nway, and we must be free of the process of analysis. \nThen what have you left? You are only used to analysis, are you not? The \nobserver observing—the observer and the observed being a joint phenomenon—\nthe observer trying to analyse that which he observes will not free him from his \nbackground. If that is so, and it is, you abandon that process, do you not? If you \nsee that it is a false way, if you realize not merely verbally but actually that it is a \nfalse process, then what happens to your analysis? You stop analysing, do you \nnot? Then what have you left? Watch it, follow it, and you will see how rapidly \nand swiftly one can be free from the background. If that is not the way, what else \nhave you left? What is the state of the mind which is accustomed to analysis, to \nprobing, looking into, dissecting, drawing conclusions and so on? If that process \nhas stopped, what is the state of your mind? \nYou say that the mind is blank. Proceed further into that blank mind. In other \nwords, when you discard what is known as being false, what has happened to \nyour mind? After all, what have you discarded? You have discarded the false \nprocess which is the outcome of a background. Is that not so? With one blow, as \nit were, you have discarded the whole thing. Therefore your mind, when you \ndiscard the analytical process with all its implications and see it as false, is freed \nfrom yesterday and therefore is capable of looking directly, without going \nthrough the process of time, and thereby discarding the background immediately. \nTo put the whole question differently, thought is the result of time, is it not? \nThought is the result of environment, of social and religious influences, which is \nall part of time. Now, can thought be free of time? That is, thought which is the \nresult of time, can it stop and be free from the process of time? Thought can be"

That can be done only when \nyou realize that which is false; and the false is obviously the analytical process \nand that is the only thing we have. When the analytical process completely stops, \nnot through enforcement but through understanding the inevitable falseness of \nthat process, then you will find that your mind is completely dissociated from the \npast—which does not mean that you do not recognize the past but that your mind \nhas no direct communion with the past. So it can free itself from the past \nimmediately, now, and this dissociation from the past, this complete freedom \nfrom yesterday, not chronologically but psychologically, is possible; and that is \nthe only way to understand reality. \nTo put it very simply, when you want to understand something, what is the \nstate of your mind? When you want to understand your child, when you want to \nunderstand somebody, something that someone is saying, what is the state of \nyour mind? You are not analysing, criticizing, judging what the other is saying; \nyou are listening, are you not? Your mind is in a state where the thought process \nis not active but is very alert.

You may understand certain \nevents, certain experiences, but the whole content of consciousness cannot be \nemptied through the analytical process.

Is it possible to \nact at all times without idea, that is, without a purpose in view? \n \nKrishnamurti: What is our action at present? What do we mean by action? Our \naction—what we want to do or to be—is based on idea, is it not? That is all we \nknow; we have ideas, ideals, promises, various formulas as to what we are and \nwhat we are not. The basis of our action is reward in the future or fear of \npunishment. We know that, don’t we? Such activity is isolating, self-enclosing. \nYou have an idea of virtue and according to that idea you live, you act, in \nrelationship. To you, relationship, collective or individual, is action which is \ntowards the ideal, towards virtue, towards achievement and so on. \nWhen my action is based on an ideal which is an idea—such as “I must be \nbrave”, “I must follow the example”, “I must be charitable”, “I must be socially \nconscious” and so on—that idea shapes my action, guides my action. We all say, \n“There is an example of virtue which I must follow”; which means, “I must live \naccording to that”. So action is based on that idea. Between action and idea, there \nis a gulf, a division, there is a time process. That is so, is it not? In other words, I \nam not charitable, I am not loving, there is no forgiveness in my heart but I feel I \nmust be charitable. So there is a gap, between what I am and what I should be; \nwe are all the time trying to bridge that gap. That is our activity, is it not? \nNow what would happen if the idea did not exist? At one stroke, you would \nhave removed the gap, would you not? You would be what you are. You say “I \nam ugly, I must become beautiful; what am I to do?”—which is action based on \nidea. You say “I am not compassionate, I must become compassionate”. So you \nintroduce idea separate from action. Therefore there is never true action of what \nyou are but always action based on the ideal of what you will be. The stupid man \nalways says he is going to become clever. He sits working, struggling to become; \nhe never stops, he never says “I am stupid”. So his action, which is based on \nidea, is not action at all. \nAction means doing, moving. But when you have idea, it is merely ideation \ngoing on, thought process going on in relation to action. If there is no idea, what \nwould happen? You are what you are. You are uncharitable, you are unforgiving, \nyou are cruel, stupid, thoughtless. Can you remain with that? If you do, then see \nwhat happens. When I recognize I am uncharitable, stupid, what happens when I \nam aware it is so? Is there not charity, is there not intelligence? When I recognize \nuncharitableness completely, not verbally, not artificially, when I realize I am \nuncharitable and unloving, in that very seeing of what is is there not love? Don’t \nI immediately become charitable? If I see the necessity of being clean, it is very \nsimple; I go and wash. But if it is an ideal that I should be clean, then what \nhappens? Cleanliness is then postponed or is superficial. \nAction based on idea is very superficial, is not true action at all, is only \nideation, which is merely the thought process going on. \nAction which transforms us as human beings, which brings regeneration, \nredemption, transformation—call it what you will—such action is not based on"

What is wrong with me? \n \nKrishnamurti: What is actually taking place in our lives? There is constant \nchallenge and response. That is existence, that is life, is it not?—a constant \nchallenge and response. The challenge is always new and the response is always \nold. I met you yesterday and you come to me today. You are different, you are \nmodified, you have changed, you are new; but I have the picture of you as you \nwere yesterday. Therefore I absorb the new into the old. I do not meet you anew \nbut I have yesterday’s picture of you, so my response to the challenge is always \nconditioned. Here, for the moment, you cease to be a Brahmin, a Christian, high-\ncaste or whatever it is—you forget everything. You are just listening, absorbed, \ntrying to find out. When you resume your daily life, you become your old self—\nyou are back in your job, your caste, your system, your family. In other words, \nthe new is always being absorbed by the old, into the old habits, customs, ideas, \ntraditions, memories. There is never the new, for you are always meeting the new \nwith the old. The challenge is new but you meet it with the old. The problem in \nthis question is how to free thought from the old so as to be new all the time. \nWhen you see a flower, when you see a face, when you see the sky, a tree, a \nsmile, how are you to meet it anew? Why is it that we do not meet it anew? Why \nis it that the old absorbs the new and modifies it; why does the new cease when \nyou go home? \nThe old response arises from the thinker. Is not the thinker always the old? \nBecause your thought is founded on the past, when you meet the new it is the \nthinker who is meeting it; the experience of yesterday is meeting it. The thinker \nis always the old. So we come back to the same problem in a different way: How \nto free the mind from itself as the thinker? How to eradicate memory, not factual \nmemory but psychological memory, which is the accumulation of experience? \nWithout freedom from the residue of experience, there can be no reception of the \nnew. To free thought, to be free of the thought process and so to meet the new is \narduous, is it not?, because all our beliefs, all our traditions, all our methods in \neducation are a process of imitation, copying, memorizing, building up the \nreservoir of memory. That memory is constantly responding to the new; the \nresponse of that memory we call thinking and that thinking meets the new. So \nhow can there be the new? Only when there is no residue of memory can there be \nnewness and there is residue when experience is not finished, concluded, ended; \nthat is when the understanding of experience is incomplete. When experience is \ncomplete, there is no residue—that is the beauty of life. Love is not residue, love \nis not experience, it is a state of being. Love is eternally new. Therefore our \nproblem is: Can one meet the new constantly, even at home? Surely one can. To \ndo that, one must bring about a revolution in thought, in feeling; you can be free \nonly when every incident is thought out from moment to moment, when every \nresponse is fully understood, not merely casually looked at and thrown aside. \nThere is freedom from accumulating memory only when every thought, every"

In other words, when each thought \nand feeling is thought out, concluded, there is an ending and there is a space \nbetween that ending and the next thought. In that space of silence, there is \nrenewal, the new creativeness takes place. \nThis is not theoretical, this is not impractical. If you try to think out every \nthought and every feeling, you will discover that it is extraordinarily practical in \nyour daily life, for then you are new and what is new is eternally enduring. To be \nnew is creative and to be creative is to be happy; a happy man is not concerned \nwhether he is rich or poor, he does not care to what level of society he belongs, to \nwhat caste or to what country. He has no leaders, no gods, no temples, no \nchurches and therefore no quarrels, no enmity. \nSurely that is the most practical way of solving our difficulties in this present \nworld of chaos? It is because we are not creative, in the sense in which I am \nusing that word, that we are so anti-social at all the different levels of our \nconsciousness. To be very practical and effective in our social relationships, in \nour relationship with everything, one must be happy; there cannot be happiness if \nthere is no ending, there cannot be happiness if there is a constant process of \nbecoming. In ending, there is renewal, rebirth, a newness, a freshness, a joy. \nThe new is absorbed into the old and the old destroys the new, so long as \nthere is background, so long as the mind, the thinker, is conditioned by his \nthought. To be free from the background, from the conditioning influences, from \nmemory, there must be freedom from continuity. There is continuity so long as \nthought and feelings are not ended completely. You complete a thought when \nyou pursue the thought to its end and thereby bring an end to every thought, to \nevery feeling. Love is not habit, memory; love is always new. There can be a \nmeeting of the new only when the mind is fresh; and the mind is not fresh so long \nas there is the residue of memory. Memory is factual, as well as psychological. I \nam not talking of factual memory but of psychological memory. So long as \nexperience is not completely understood, there is residue, which is the old, which \nis of yesterday, the thing that is past; the past is always absorbing the new and \ntherefore destroying the new. It is only when the mind is free from the old that it \nmeets everything anew, and in that there is joy."

If \nI am aware of a feeling, I seem to know what that feeling is almost immediately \nafter it arises. Or do you mean something different when you say, ‘Do not \nname’? \n \nKrishnamurti: Why do we name anything? Why do we give a label to a flower, \nto a person, to a feeling? Either to communicate one’s feelings, to describe the \nflower and so on and so on; or to identify oneself with that feeling. Is not that so? \nI name something, a feeling, to communicate it. ‘I am angry.’ Or I identify \nmyself with that feeling in order to strengthen it or to dissolve it or to do \nsomething about it. We give a name to something, to a rose, to communicate it to \nothers or, by giving it a name, we think we have understood it. We say, “That is a \nrose”, rapidly look at it and go on. By giving it a name, we think we have \nunderstood it; we have classified it and think that thereby we have understood the \nwhole content and beauty of that flower. \nBy giving a name to something, we have merely put it into a category and we \nthink we have understood it; we don’t look at it more closely. If we do not give it \na name, however, we are forced to look at it. That is we approach the flower or \nwhatever it is with a newness, with a new quality of examination; we look at it as \nthough we had never looked at it before. Naming is a very convenient way of \ndisposing of things and of people—by saying that they are Germans, Japanese, \nAmericans, Hindus, you can give them a label and destroy the label. If you do \nnot give a label to people you are forced to look at them and then it is much more \ndifficult to kill somebody. You can destroy the label with a bomb and feel \nrighteous, but if you do not give a label and must therefore look at the individual \nthing—whether it is a man or a flower or an incident or an emotion—then you \nare forced to consider your relationship with it, and with the action following. So \nterming or giving a label is a very convenient way of disposing of anything, of \ndenying, condemning or justifying it. That is one side of the question. \nWhat is the core from which you name, what is the centre which is always \nnaming, choosing, labelling? We all feel there is a centre, a core, do we not?, \nfrom which we are acting, from which we are judging, from which we are \nnaming. What is that centre, that core? Some would like to think it is a spiritual \nessence, God, or what you will. So let us find out what is that core, that centre, \nwhich is naming, terming, judging. Surely that core is memory, isn’t it? A series \nof sensations, identified and enclosed—the past, given life through the present. \nThat core, that centre, feeds on the present through naming, labelling, \nremembering. \nWe will see presently, as we unfold it, that so long as this centre, this core, \nexists, there can be no understanding. It is only with the dissipation of this core \nthat there is understanding, because, after all, that core is memory; memory of \nvarious experiences which have been given names, labels, identifications. With \nthose named and labelled experiences, from that centre, there is acceptance and \nrejection, determination to be or not to be, according to the sensations, pleasures"

That is if you do not think in terms of words, \nif you do not use words, can you think? Thinking comes into being through \nverbalization; or verbalization begins to respond to thinking. The centre, the core \nis the memory of innumerable experiences of pleasure and pain, verbalized. \nWatch it in yourself, please, and you will see that words have become much \nmore important, labels have become much more important, than the substance; \nand we live on words. \nFor us, words like truth, God, have become very important—or the feeling \nwhich those words represent. When we say the word ‘American’, ‘Christian’, \n‘Hindu’ or the word ‘anger’—we are the word representing the feeling. But we \ndon’t know what that feeling is, because the word has become important. When \nyou call yourself a Buddhist, a Christian, what does the word mean, what is the \nmeaning behind that word, which you have never examined? Our centre, the core \nis the word, the label. If the label does not matter, if what matters is that which is \nbehind the label, then you are able to inquire but if you are identified with the \nlabel and stuck with it, you cannot proceed. And we are identified with the label: \nthe house, the form, the name, the furniture, the bank account, our opinions, our \nstimulants and so on and so on. We are all those things—those things being \nrepresented by a name. The things have become important, the names, the labels; \nand therefore the centre, the core, is the word. \nIf there is no word, no label, there is no centre, is there? There is a \ndissolution, there is an emptiness—not the emptiness of fear, which is quite a \ndifferent thing. There is a sense of being as nothing; because you have removed \nall the labels or rather because you have understood why you give labels to \nfeelings and ideas you are completely new, are you not? There is no centre from \nwhich you are acting. The centre, which is the word, has been dissolved. The \nlabel has been taken away and where are you as the centre? You are there but \nthere has been a transformation. That transformation is a little bit frightening; \ntherefore, you do not proceed with what is still involved in it; you are already \nbeginning to judge it, to decide whether you like it or don’t like it. You don’t \nproceed with the understanding of what is coming but you are already judging, \nwhich means that you have a centre from which you are acting. Therefore you \nstay fixed the moment you judge; the words ‘like’ and ‘dislike’ become \nimportant. But what happens when you do not name? You look at an emotion, at \na sensation, more directly and therefore have quite a different relationship to it, \njust as you have to a flower when you do not name it. You are forced to look at it \nanew. When you do not name a group of people, you are compelled to look at \neach individual face and not treat them all as the mass. Therefore you are much \nmore alert, much more observing, more understanding; you have a deeper sense \nof pity, love; but if you treat them all as the mass, it is over. \nIf you do not label, you have to regard every feeling as it arises. When you \nlabel, is the feeling different from the label? Or does the label awaken the \nfeeling? Please think it over. When we label, most of us intensify the feeling.

Not how to subjugate it, sublimate it, suppress it, which are all \nidiotic and immature, but how to be really free from it? To be really free from it, \nwe have to discover whether the word is more important than the feeling. The \nword ‘anger’ has more significance than the feeling itself. Really to find that out \nthere must be a gap between the feeling and the naming. That is one part. \nIf I do not name a feeling, that is to say if thought is not functioning merely \nbecause of words or if I do not think in terms of words, images or symbols, \nwhich most of us do—then what happens? Surely the mind then is not merely the \nobserver. When the mind is not thinking in terms of words, symbols, images, \nthere is no thinker separate from the thought, which is the word. Then the mind is \nquiet, is it not?—not made quiet, it is quiet. When the mind is really quiet, then \nthe feelings which arise can be dealt with immediately. It is only when we give \nnames to feelings and thereby strengthen them that the feelings have continuity; \nthey are stored up in the centre, from which we give further labels, either to \nstrengthen or to communicate them. \nWhen the mind is no longer the centre, as the thinker made up of words, of \npast experiences—which are all memories, labels, stored up and put in \ncategories, in pigeonholes—when it is not doing any of those things, then, \nobviously the mind is quiet. It is no longer bound, it has no longer a centre as the \nme—my house, my achievement, my work—which are still words, giving \nimpetus to feeling and thereby strengthening memory. When none of these things \nis happening, the mind is very quiet. That state is not negation. On the contrary, \nto come to that point, you have to go through all this, which is an enormous \nundertaking; it is not merely learning a few sets of words and repeating them like \na schoolboy—‘not to name’, ‘not to name’. To follow through all its \nimplications, to experience it, to see how the mind works and thereby come to \nthat point when you are no longer naming, which means that there is no longer a \ncentre apart from thought—surely this whole process is real meditation. \nWhen the mind is really tranquil, then it is possible for that which is \nimmeasurable to come into being. Any other process, any other search for reality, \nis merely self-projected, home-made and therefore unreal. But this process is \narduous and it means that the mind has to be constantly aware of everything that \nis inwardly happening to it. To come to this point, there can be no judgement or \njustification from the beginning to the end—not that this is an end. There is no \nend, because there is something extraordinary still going on. This is no promise. \nIt is for you to experiment, to go into yourself deeper and deeper and deeper, so \nthat all the many layers of the centre are dissolved and you can do it rapidly or \nlazily. It is extraordinarily interesting to watch the process of the mind, how it \ndepends on words, how the words stimulate memory or resuscitate the dead \nexperience and give life to it. In that process the mind is living either in the future \nor in the past. Therefore words have an enormous significance, neurologically as \nwell as psychologically.

What is it in us that drives us to find \nthe unknown reality, God? \n \nKrishnamurti: Does your mind urge toward the unknown? Is there an urge in us \nfor the unknown, for reality, for God? Please think it out seriously. This is not a \nrhetorical question but let us actually find out. Is there an inward urge in each \none of us to find the unknown? Is there? How can you find the unknown? If you \ndo not know it, how can you find it? Is there an urge for reality, or is it merely a \ndesire for the known, expanded? Do you understand what I mean? I have known \nmany things; they have not given me happiness, satisfaction, joy. So now I am \nwanting something else that will give me greater joy, greater happiness, greater \nvitality—what you will. Can the known, which is my mind—because my mind is \nknown, the result of the past—can that mind seek the unknown? If I do not know \nreality, the unknown, how can I search for it? Surely it must come, I cannot go \nafter it. If I go after it, I am going after something which is the known, projected \nby me. \nOur problem is not what it is in us that drives us to find the unknown—that is \nclear enough. It is our own desire to be more secure, more permanent, more \nestablished, more happy, to escape from turmoil, from pain, confusion. That is \nour obvious drive. When there is that drive, that urge, you will find a marvellous \nescape, a marvellous refuge—in the Buddha, in the Christ or in political slogans \nand all the rest of it. That is not reality; that is not the unknowable, the unknown. \nTherefore the urge for the unknown must come to an end, the search for the \nunknown must stop; which means there must be understanding of the cumulative \nknown, which is the mind. The mind must understand itself as the known, \nbecause that is all it knows. You cannot think about something that you do not \nknow. You can only think about something that you know. \nOur difficulty is for the mind not to proceed in the known; that can only \nhappen when the mind understands itself and how all its movement is from the \npast, projecting itself through the present, to the future. It is one continuous \nmovement of the known; can that movement come to an end? It can come to an \nend only when the mechanism of its own process is understood, only when the \nmind understands itself and its workings, its ways, its purposes, its pursuits, its \ndemands—not only the superficial demands but the deep inward urges and \nmotives. This is quite an arduous task. It isn’t just in a meeting or at a lecture or \nby reading a book, that you are going to find out. On the contrary, it needs \nconstant watchfulness, constant awareness of every movement of thought—not \nonly when you are waking but also when you are asleep. It must be a total \nprocess, not a sporadic, partial process. \nAlso, the intention must be right. That is there must be a cessation of the \nsuperstition that inwardly we all want the unknown. It is an illusion to think that \nwe are all seeking God—we are not. We don’t have to search for light. There \nwill be light when there is no darkness and through darkness we cannot find the \nlight. All that we can do is to remove those barriers that create darkness and the"

Even to look beyond the darkness is an escape from darkness. \nWe have to consider not what it is that is driving us but why there is in us \nsuch confusion, such turmoil, such strife and antagonism—all the stupid things of \nour existence. When these are not, then there is light, we don’t have to look for it. \nWhen stupidity is gone, there is intelligence. But the man who is stupid and tries \nto become intelligent is still stupid. Stupidity can never be made wisdom; only \nwhen stupidity ceases is there wisdom, intelligence. The man who is stupid and \ntries to become intelligent, wise, obviously can never be so. To know what is \nstupidity, one must go into it, not superficially, but fully, completely, deeply, \nprofoundly; one must go into all the different layers of stupidity and when there \nis the cessation of that stupidity, there is wisdom. \nTherefore it is important to find out not if there is something more, something \ngreater than the known, which is urging us to the unknown, but to see what it is \nin us that is creating confusion, wars, class differences, snobbishness, the pursuit \nof the famous, the accumulation of knowledge, the escape through music, \nthrough art, through so many ways. It is important, surely, to see them as they are \nand to come back to ourselves as we are. From there we can proceed. Then the \nthrowing off of the known is comparatively easy. When the mind is silent, when \nit is no longer projecting itself into the future, wishing for something; when the \nmind is really quiet, profoundly peaceful, the unknown comes into being. You \ndon’t have to search for it. You cannot invite it. That which you can invite is only \nthat which you know. You cannot invite an unknown guest. You can only invite \none you know. But you do not know the unknown, God, reality, or what you will. \nIt must come. It can come only when the field is right, when the soil is tilled, but \nif you till in order for it to come, then you will not have it. \nOur problem is not how to seek the unknowable, but to understand the \naccumulative processes of the mind, which is ever the known. That is an arduous \ntask: that demands constant attention, a constant awareness in which there is no \nsense of distraction, of identification, of condemnation; it is being with what is. \nThen only can the mind be still. No amount of meditation, discipline, can make \nthe mind still, in the real sense of the word. Only when the breezes stop does the \nlake become quiet. You cannot make the lake quiet. Our job is not to pursue the \nunknowable but to understand the confusion, the turmoil, the misery, in \nourselves; and then that thing darkly comes into being, in which there is joy."

Is not this a profound and subtle problem \non all the levels of our existence? \n \nKrishnamurti: There are two questions in this, so let us examine the first, which \nis: When a truth is repeated, how does it become a lie? What is it that we repeat? \nCan you repeat an understanding? I understand something. Can I repeat it? I can \nverbalize it, I can communicate it but the experience is not what is repeated, \nsurely? We get caught in the word and miss the significance of the experience. If \nyou have had an experience, can you repeat it? You may want to repeat it, you \nmay have the desire for its repetition, for its sensation, but once you have had an \nexperience, it is over, it cannot be repeated. What can be repeated is the sensation \nand the corresponding word that gives life to that sensation. As, unfortunately, \nmost of us are propagandists, we are caught in the repetition of the word. So we \nlive on words, and the truth is denied. \nTake, for example, the feeling of love. Can you repeat it? When you hear the \nwords ‘Love your neighbour’, is that a truth to you? It is truth only when you do \nlove your neighbour; and that love cannot be repeated but only the word. Yet \nmost of us are happy, content, with the repetition, ‘Love your neighbour’ or \n‘Don’t be greedy’. So the truth of another, or an actual experience which you \nhave had, merely through repetition, does not become a reality. On the contrary, \nrepetition prevents reality. Merely repeating certain ideas is not reality. \nThe difficulty in this is to understand the question without thinking in terms \nof the opposite. A lie is not something opposed to truth. One can see the truth of \nwhat is being said, not in opposition or in contrast, as a lie or a truth; but just see \nthat most of us repeat without understanding. For instance, we have been \ndiscussing naming and not naming a feeling and so on. Many of you will repeat \nit, I am sure, thinking that it is the ‘truth’. You will never repeat an experience if \nit is a direct experience. You may communicate it but when it is a real \nexperience the sensations behind it are gone, the emotional content behind the \nwords is entirely dissipated. \nTake, for example, the idea that the thinker and the thought are one. It may be \na truth to you, because you have directly experienced it. If I repeated it, it would \nnot be true, would it?—true, not as opposed to the false, please. It would not be \nactual, it would be merely repetitive and therefore would have no significance. \nYou see, by repetition we create a dogma, we build a church and in that we take \nrefuge. The word and not truth, becomes the ‘truth’. The word is not the thing. \nTo us, the thing is the word and that is why one has to be so extremely careful \nnot to repeat something which one does not really understand. If you understand \nsomething, you can communicate it, but the words and the memory have lost \ntheir emotional significance. Therefore if one understands that, in ordinary \nconversation, one’s outlook, one’s vocabulary, changes. \nAs we are seeking truth through self-knowledge and are not mere \npropagandists, it is important to understand this.

To \nbe free of that, it is imperative to experience directly and to experience directly \none must be aware of oneself in the process of repetition, of habits, or words, of \nsensations. That awareness gives one an extraordinary freedom, so that there can \nbe a renewal, a constant experiencing, a newness. \nThe other question is: “What really is a lie? Why is it wrong to lie? Is this not \na profound and subtle problem on all the levels of our existence?” \nWhat is a lie? A contradiction, isn’t it?, a self-contradiction. One can \nconsciously contradict or unconsciously; it can either be deliberate or \nunconscious; the contradiction can be either very, very subtle or obvious. When \nthe cleavage in contradiction is very great, then either one becomes unbalanced \nor one realizes the cleavage and sets about to mend it. \nTo understand this problem, what is a lie and why we lie, one has to go into it \nwithout thinking in terms of an opposite. Can we look at this problem of \ncontradiction in ourselves without trying not to be contradictory? Our difficulty \nin examining this question is, is it not?, that we so readily condemn a lie but, to \nunderstand it, can we think of it not in terms of truth and falsehood but of what is \ncontradiction? Why do we contradict? Why is there contradiction in ourselves? \nIs there not an attempt to live up to a standard, up to a pattern—a constant \napproximation of ourselves to a pattern, a constant effort to be something, either \nin the eyes of another or in our own eyes? There is a desire, is there not?, to \nconform to a pattern; when one is not living up to that pattern, there is \ncontradiction. \nNow why do we have a pattern, a standard, an approximation, an idea which \nwe are trying to live up to? Why? Obviously to be secure, to be safe, to be \npopular, to have a good opinion of ourselves and so on. There is the seed of \ncontradiction. As long as we are approximating ourselves to something, trying to \nbe something, there must be contradiction; therefore there must be this cleavage \nbetween the false and the true. I think this is important, if you will quietly go into \nit. Not that there is not the false and the true; but why the contradiction in \nourselves? Is it not because we are attempting to be something—to be noble, to \nbe good, to be virtuous, to be creative, to be happy and so on? In the very desire \nto be something, there is a contradiction—not to be something else. It is this \ncontradiction that is so destructive. If one is capable of complete identification \nwith something, with this or with that, then contradiction ceases; when we do \nidentify ourselves completely with something, there is self-enclosure, there is a \nresistance, which brings about unbalance—which is an obvious thing. \nWhy is there contradiction in ourselves? I have done something and I do not \nwant it to be discovered; I have thought something which does not come up to \nthe mark, which puts me in a state of contradiction, and I do not like it. Where \nthere is approximation, there must be fear and it is this fear that contradicts. \nWhereas if there is no becoming, no attempting to be something, then there is no \nsense of fear; there is no contradiction; there is no lie in us at any level, \nconsciously or unconsciously—something to be suppressed, something to be \nshown up.

Let us look at this \nquestion, not asking what is a lie and what is truth but, without these opposites, \ngo into the problem of contradiction in ourselves—which is extremely difficult, \nbecause as we depend so much on sensations, most of our lives are contradictory. \nWe depend on memories, on opinions; we have so many fears which we want to \ncover up—all these create contradiction in ourselves; when that contradiction \nbecomes unbearable, one goes off one’s head. One wants peace and everything \nthat one does creates war, not only in the family but outside. Instead of \nunderstanding what creates conflict, we only try to become more and more one \nthing or the other, the opposite, thereby creating greater cleavage. \nIs it possible to understand why there is contradiction in ourselves—not only \nsuperficially but much more deeply, psychologically? First of all, is one aware \nthat one lives a contradictory life? We want peace and we are nationalists; we \nwant to avoid social misery and yet each one of us is individualistic, limited, self-\nenclosed. We are constantly living in contradiction. Why?

It is this state of \ncontradiction which creates the lie. In opposition to that, we create ‘truth’. But \nsurely truth is not the opposite of a lie. That which has an opposite is not truth. \nThe opposite contains its own opposite, therefore it is not truth and to understand \nthis problem very profoundly, one must be aware of all the contradictions in \nwhich we live. When I say, ‘I love you’, with it goes jealousy, envy, anxiety, \nfear—which is contradiction. It is this contradiction which must be understood \nand one can understand it only when one is aware of it, aware without any \ncondemnation or justification—merely looking at it. To look at it passively, one \nhas to understand all the processes of justification and condemnation. \nIt is not an easy thing, to look passively at something; but in understanding \nthat, one begins to understand the whole process of the ways of one’s feeling and \nthinking. When one is aware of the full significance of contradiction in oneself, it \nbrings an extraordinary change: you are yourself, then, not something you are \ntrying to be. You are no longer following an ideal, seeking happiness. You are \nwhat you are and from there you can proceed. Then there is no possibility of \ncontradiction."

Surely my realization has nothing whatever to do with what I \nam saying and the man who worships another because that other has realized is \nreally worshipping authority and therefore he can never find the truth. To \nunderstand what has been realized and to know him who has realized is not at all \nimportant, is it? \nI know the whole tradition says, “Be with a man who has realized.” How can \nyou know that he has realized? All that you can do is to keep company with him \nand even that is extremely difficult nowadays. There are very few good people, \nin the real sense of the word—people who are not seeking something, who are \nnot after something. Those who are seeking something or are after something are \nexploiters and therefore it is very difficult for anyone to find a companion to \nlove. \nWe idealize those who have realized and hope that they will give us \nsomething, which is a false relationship. How can the man who has realized \ncommunicate if there is no love? That is our difficulty. In all our discussions we \ndo not really love each other; we are suspicious. You want something from me, \nknowledge, realization, or you want to keep company with me, all of which \nindicates that you do not love. You want something and therefore you are out to \nexploit. If we really love each other then there will be instantaneous \ncommunication. Then it does not matter if you have realized and I have not or if \nyou are the high or the low. Since our hearts have withered, God has become \nawfully important. That is, you want to know God because you have lost the \nsong in your heart and you pursue the singer and ask him whether he can teach \nyou how to sing. He can teach you the technique but the technique will not lead \nyou to creation. You cannot be a musician by merely knowing how to sing. You \nmay know all the steps of a dance but if you have not creation in your heart, you \nare only functioning as a machine. You cannot love if your object is merely to \nachieve a result. There is no such thing as an ideal, because that is merely an \nachievement. Beauty is not an achievement, it is reality, now, not tomorrow. If \nthere is love you will understand the unknown, you will know what God is and \nnobody need tell you—and that is the beauty of love. It is eternity in itself. \nBecause there is no love, we want someone else, or God, to give it to us. If we \nreally loved, do you know what a different world this would be? We should be \nreally happy people. Therefore we should not invest our happiness in things, in \nfamily, in ideals. We should be happy and therefore things, people and ideals \nwould not dominate our lives. They are all secondary things. Because we do not"

Can the indescribable be put into \nwords? Can you measure something immeasurable? Can you catch the wind in \nyour fist? If you do, is that the wind? If you measure that which is immeasurable, \nis that the real? If you formulate it, is it the real? Surely not, for the moment you \ndescribe something which is indescribable, it ceases to be the real. The moment \nyou translate the unknowable into the known, it ceases to be the unknowable. Yet \nthat is what we are hankering after. All the time we want to know, because then \nwe shall be able to continue, then we shall be able, we think, to capture ultimate \nhappiness, permanency. We want to know because we are not happy, because we \nare striving miserably, because we are worn out, degraded. Yet instead of \nrealizing the simple fact—that we are degraded, that we are dull, weary, in \nturmoil—we want to move away from what is the known into the unknown, \nwhich again becomes the known and therefore we can never find the real. \nTherefore instead of asking who has realized or what God is why not give \nyour whole attention and awareness to what is? Then you will find the unknown, \nor rather it will come to you. If you understand what is the known, you will \nexperience that extraordinary silence which is not induced, not enforced, that \ncreative emptiness in which alone reality can enter. It cannot come to that which \nis becoming, which is striving; it can only come to that which is being, which \nunderstands what is. Then you will see that reality is not in the distance; the \nunknown is not far off; it is in what is. As the answer to a problem is in the \nproblem, so reality is in what is; if we can understand it, then we shall know \ntruth. \nIt is extremely difficult to be aware of dullness, to be aware of greed, to be \naware of ill will, ambition and so on. The very fact of being aware of what is is \ntruth. It is truth that liberates, not your striving to be free. Thus reality is not far \nbut we place it far away because we try to use it as a means of self-continuity. It \nis here, now, in the immediate. The eternal or the timeless is now and the now \ncannot be understood by a man who is caught in the net of time. To free thought \nfrom time demands action, but the mind is lazy, it is slothful, and therefore ever \ncreates other hindrances. It is only possible by right meditation, which means \ncomplete action, not a continuous action, and complete action can only be \nunderstood when the mind comprehends the process of continuity, which is \nmemory—not the factual but the psychological memory. As long as memory \nfunctions, the mind cannot understand what is. But one’s mind, one’s whole \nbeing, becomes extraordinarily creative, passively alert, when one understands \nthe significance of ending, because in ending there is renewal, while in continuity \nthere is death, there is decay."

O N  I M M E D I A T E  R E A L I Z A T I O N \n \nQuestion: Can we realize on the spot the truth you are speaking of, without any \nprevious preparation? \n \nKrishnamurti: What do you mean by truth? Do not let us use a word of which we \ndo not know the meaning; we can use a simpler word, a more direct word. Can \nyou understand, can you comprehend a problem directly? That is what is implied, \nis it not? Can you understand what is, immediately, now? In understanding what \nis, you will understand the significance of truth; but to say that one must \nunderstand truth has very little meaning. Can you understand a problem directly, \nfully, and be free of it? That is what is implied in this question, is it not? Can you \nunderstand a crisis, a challenge, immediately, see its whole significance and be \nfree of it? What you understand leaves no mark; therefore understanding or truth \nis the liberator. Can you be liberated now from a problem, from a challenge? Life \nis, is it not?, a series of challenges and responses and if your response to a \nchallenge is conditioned, limited, incomplete, then that challenge leaves its mark, \nits residue, which is further strengthened by another new challenge. So there is a \nconstant residual memory, accumulations, scars, and with all these scars you try \nto meet the new and therefore you never meet the new. Therefore you never \nunderstand, there is never a liberation from any challenge. \nThe problem, the question is, whether I can understand a challenge \ncompletely, directly; sense all its significance, all its perfume, its depth, its \nbeauty and its ugliness and so be free of it. A challenge is always new, is it not? \nThe problem is always new, is it not? A problem which you had yesterday, for \nexample, has undergone such modification that when you meet it today, it is \nalready new. But you meet it with the old, because you meet it without \ntransforming, merely modifying your own thoughts. \nLet me put it in a different way. I met you yesterday. In the meantime you \nhave changed. You have undergone a modification but I still have yesterday’s \npicture of you. I meet you today with my picture of you and therefore I do not \nunderstand you—I understand only the picture of you which I acquired \nyesterday. If I want to understand you, who are modified, changed, I must \nremove, I must be free of the picture of yesterday. In other words to understand a \nchallenge, which is always new, I must also meet it anew, there must be no \nresidue of yesterday; so I must say adieu to yesterday. \nAfter all, what is life? It is something new all the time, is it not? It is \nsomething which is ever undergoing change, creating a new feeling. Today is \nnever the same as yesterday and that is the beauty of life. Can you and I meet \nevery problem anew? Can you, when you go home, meet your wife and your \nchild anew, meet the challenge anew? You will not be able to do it if you are \nburdened with the memories of yesterday. Therefore, to understand the truth of a \nproblem, of a relationship, you must come to it afresh—not with an ‘open mind’, \nfor that has no meaning. You must come to it without the scars of yesterday’s \nmemories—which means, as each challenge arises, be aware of all the responses"

I say yes—not out of \nsome fancy of mine, not out of some illusion; but psychologically experiment \nwith it and you will see. Take any challenge, any small incident—don’t wait for \nsome great crisis—and see how you respond to it. Be aware of it, of your \nresponses, of your intentions, of your attitudes and you will understand them, you \nwill understand your background. I assure you, you can do it immediately if you \ngive your whole attention to it. If you are seeking the full meaning of your \nbackground, it yields its significance and then you discover in one stroke the \ntruth, the understanding of the problem. Understanding comes into being from \nthe now, the present, which is always timeless. Though it may be tomorrow, it is \nstill now; merely to postpone, to prepare to receive that which is tomorrow, is to \nprevent yourself from understanding what is now. Surely you can understand \ndirectly what is now, can’t you? To understand what is, you have to be \nundisturbed, undistracted, you have to give your mind and heart to it. It must be \nyour sole interest at that moment, completely. Then what is gives you its full \ndepth, its full meaning, and thereby you are free of that problem. \nIf you want to know the truth, the psychological significance of property, for \ninstance, if you really want to understand it directly, now, how do you approach \nit? Surely you must feel akin to the problem, you must not be afraid of it, you \nmust not have any creed, any answer, between yourself and the problem. Only \nwhen you are directly in relationship with the problem will you find the answer. \nIf you introduce an answer, if you judge, have a psychological disinclination, \nthen you will postpone, you will prepare to understand tomorrow what can only \nbe understood in the ‘now’. Therefore you will never understand. To perceive \ntruth needs no preparation; preparation implies time and time is not the means of \nunderstanding truth. Time is continuity and truth is timeless, non-continuous. \nUnderstanding is non-continuous, it is from moment to moment, unresidual. \nI am afraid I am making it all sound very difficult, am I not? But it is easy, \nsimple to understand, if you will only experiment with it. If you go off into a \ndream, meditate over it, it becomes very difficult. When there is no barrier \nbetween you and me, I understand you. If I am open to you, I understand you \ndirectly—and to be open is not a matter of time. Will time make me open? Will \npreparation, system, discipline, make me open to you? No. What will make me \nopen to you is my intention to understand. I want to be open because I have \nnothing to hide, I am not afraid; therefore I am open and there is immediate \ncommunion, there is truth. To receive truth, to know its beauty, to know its joy, \nthere must be instant receptivity, unclouded by theories, fears and answers."

Does it imply seeing very clearly the essentials \nand discarding everything else? \n \nKrishnamurti: Let us see what simplicity is not. Don’t say—“That is negation” or \n“Tell us something positive”. That is immature, thoughtless reaction. Those \npeople who offer you the ‘positive’ are exploiters; they have something to give \nyou which you want and through which they exploit you. We are doing nothing \nof that kind. We are trying to find out the truth of simplicity. Therefore you must \ndiscard, put ideas behind and observe anew. The man who has much is afraid of \nrevolution, inwardly and outwardly. \nLet us find out what is not simplicity. A complicated mind is not simple, is it? \nA clever mind is not simple; a mind that has an end in view for which it is \nworking, a reward, a fear, is not a simple mind, is it? A mind that is burdened \nwith knowledge is not a simple mind; a mind that is crippled with beliefs is not a \nsimple mind, is it? A mind that has identified itself with something greater and is \nstriving to keep that identity, is not a simple mind, is it? We think it is simple to \nhave only one or two loincloths, we want the outward show of simplicity and we \nare easily deceived by that. That is why the man who is very rich worships the \nman who has renounced. \nWhat is simplicity? Can simplicity be the discarding of non-essentials and the \npursuing of essentials—which means a process of choice? Does it not mean \nchoice—choosing essentials and discarding non-essentials? What is this process \nof choosing? What is the entity that chooses? Mind, is it not? It does not matter \nwhat you call it. You say, ‘I will choose this, which is the essential’. How do you \nknow what is the essential? Either you have a pattern of what other people have \nsaid or your own experience says that something is the essential. Can you rely on \nyour experience? When you choose, your choice is based on desire, is it not? \nWhat you call ‘the essential’ is that which gives you satisfaction. So you are back \nagain in the same process, are you not? Can a confused mind choose? If it does, \nthe choice must also be confused. \nTherefore the choice between the essential and the non-essential is not \nsimplicity. It is a conflict. A mind in conflict, in confusion, can never be simple. \nWhen you discard, when you really observe and see all these false things, the \ntricks of the mind, when you look at it and are aware of it, then you will know for \nyourself what simplicity is. A mind which is bound by belief is never a simple \nmind. A mind that is crippled with knowledge is not simple. A mind that is \ndistracted by God, by women, by music, is not a simple mind. A mind caught in \nthe routine of the office, of rituals, of prayers, such a mind is not simple. \nSimplicity is action, without idea. But that is a very rare thing; that means \ncreativeness. So long as there is not creation, we are centres of mischief, misery \nand destruction. Simplicity is not a thing which you can pursue and experience. \nSimplicity comes, as a flower opens at the right moment, when each one \nunderstands the whole process of existence and relationship. Because we have \nnever thought about it, observed it, we are not aware of it; we value all the outer"

O N  S U P E R F I C I A L I T Y \n \nQuestion: How is one who is superficial to become serious? \n \nKrishnamurti: First of all, we must be aware that we are superficial, must we \nnot? What does it mean to be superficial? Essentially, to be dependent, does it \nnot? To depend on stimulation, to depend on challenge, to depend on another, to \ndepend psychologically on certain values, certain experiences, certain \nmemories—does not all that make for superficiality? When I depend on going to \nchurch every morning or every week in order to be uplifted, in order to be \nhelped, does that not make me superficial? If I have to perform certain rituals to \nmaintain my sense of integrity or to regain a feeling which I may once have had, \ndoes that not make me superficial? Does it not make me superficial when I give \nmyself over to a country, to a plan or to a particular political group? Surely this \nwhole process of dependence is an evasion of myself; this identification with the \ngreater is the denial of what I am. But I cannot deny what I am; I must \nunderstand what I am and not try to identify myself with the universe, with God, \nwith a particular political party or what you will. All this leads to shallow \nthinking and from shallow thinking there is activity which is everlastingly \nmischievous, whether on a worldwide scale, or on the individual scale. \nFirst of all, do we recognize that we are doing these things? We do not; we \njustify them. We say, “What shall I do if I don’t do these things? I’ll be worse \noff; my mind will go to pieces. Now, at least, I am struggling towards something \nbetter.” The more we struggle the more superficial we are. I have to see that first, \nhave I not? That is one of the most difficult things; to see what I am, to \nacknowledge that I am stupid, that I am shallow, that I am narrow, that I am \njealous. If I see what I am, if I recognize it, then with that I can start. Surely, a \nshallow mind is a mind that escapes from what is; not to escape requires arduous \ninvestigation, the denial of inertia. The moment I know I am shallow, there is \nalready a process of deepening—if I don’t do anything about the shallowness. If \nthe mind says, “I am petty, and I am going to go into it, I am going to understand \nthe whole of this pettiness, this narrowing influence”, then there is a possibility \nof transformation; but a petty mind, acknowledging that it is petty and trying to \nbe non-petty by reading, by meeting people, by travelling, by being incessantly \nactive like a monkey, is still a petty mind. \nAgain, you see, there is a real revolution only if we approach this problem \nrightly. The right approach to the problem gives an extraordinary confidence \nwhich I assure you moves mountains—the mountains of one’s own prejudices, \nconditionings. Being aware of a shallow mind, do not try to become deep. A \nshallow mind can never know great depths. It can have plenty of knowledge, \ninformation, it can repeat words—you know the whole paraphernalia of a \nsuperficial mind that is active. But if you know that you are superficial, shallow, \nif you are aware of the shallowness and observe all its activities without judging, \nwithout condemnation, then you will soon see that the shallow thing has \ndisappeared entirely, without your action upon it. That requires patience,"

O N  T R I V I A L I T Y \n \nQuestion: With what should the mind be occupied? \n \nKrishnamurti: Here is a very good example of how conflict is brought into being: \nthe conflict between what should be and what is. First we establish what should \nbe, the ideal, and then try to live according to that pattern. We say that the mind \nshould be occupied with noble things, with unselfishness, with generosity, with \nkindliness, with love; that is the pattern, the belief, the should be, the must, and \nwe try to live accordingly. So there is a conflict set going, between the projection \nof what should be and the actuality, the what is, and through that conflict we \nhope to be transformed. So long as we are struggling with the should be, we feel \nvirtuous, we feel good, but which is important: the should be or what is? With \nwhat are our minds occupied—actually, not ideologically? With trivialities, are \nthey not? With how one looks, with ambition, with greed, with envy, with gossip, \nwith cruelty. The mind lives in a world of trivialities and a trivial mind creating a \nnoble pattern is still trivial, is it not? The question is not with what should the \nmind be occupied but can the mind free itself from trivialities? If we are at all \naware, if we are at all inquiring, we know our own particular trivialities: \nincessant talk, the everlasting chattering of the mind, worry over this and that, \ncuriosity as to what people are doing or not doing, trying to achieve a result, \ngroping after one’s own aggrandizement and so on. With that we are occupied \nand we know it very well. Can that be transformed? That is the problem, is it \nnot? To ask with what the mind should be occupied is mere immaturity. \nNow, being aware that my mind is trivial and occupied with trivialities, can it \nfree itself from this condition? Is not the mind, by its very nature, trivial? What is \nthe mind but the result of memory? Memory of what? Of how to survive, not \nonly physically but also psychologically through the development of certain \nqualities, virtues, the storing up of experiences, the establishing of itself in its \nown activities. Is that not trivial? The mind, being the result of memory, of time, \nis trivial in itself; what can it do to free itself from its own triviality? Can it do \nanything? Please see the importance of this. Can the mind, which is self-centred \nactivity, free itself from that activity? Obviously, it cannot; whatever it does, it is \nstill trivial. It can speculate about God, it can devise political systems, it can \ninvent beliefs; but it is still within the field of time, its change is still from \nmemory to memory, it is still bound by its own limitation. Can the mind break \ndown that limitation? Or does that limitation break down when the mind is quiet, \nwhen it is not active, when it recognizes its own trivialities, however great it may \nhave imagined them to be? When the mind, having seen its trivialities, is fully \naware of them and so becomes really quiet—only then is there a possibility of \nthese trivialities dropping away. So long as you are inquiring with what the mind \nshould be occupied, it will be occupied with trivialities, whether it builds a \nchurch, whether it prays or whether it goes to a shrine. The mind itself is petty, \nsmall, and by merely saying it is petty you haven’t dissolved its pettiness. You \nhave to understand it, the mind has to recognize its own activities, and in the \nprocess of that recognition, in the awareness of the trivialities which it has"

If we have a problem, we worry over it, don’t we? We go into it, \nwe analyse it, we tear it to pieces, in the hope of understanding it. Now, do we \nunderstand through effort, through analysis, through comparison, through any \nform of mental struggle? Surely, understanding comes only when the mind is \nvery quiet. We say that the more we struggle with the question of starvation, of \nwar, or any other human problem, the more we come into conflict with it, the \nbetter we shall understand it. Now, is that true? Wars have been going on for \ncenturies, the conflict between individuals, between societies; war, inward and \noutward, is constantly there. Do we resolve that war, that conflict, by further \nconflict, by further struggle, by cunning endeavour? Or do we understand the \nproblem only when we are directly in front of it, when we are faced with the \nfact? We can face the fact only when there is no interfering agitation between the \nmind and the fact, so is it not important, if we are to understand, that the mind be \nquiet? \nYou will inevitably ask, “How can the mind be made still?” That is the \nimmediate response, is it not? You say, “My mind is agitated and how can I keep \nit quiet?” Can any system make the mind quiet? Can a formula, a discipline, \nmake the mind still? It can; but when the mind is made still, is that quietness, is \nthat stillness? Or is the mind only enclosed within an idea, within a formula, \nwithin a phrase? Such a mind is a dead mind, is it not? That is why most people \nwho try to be spiritual, so-called spiritual, are dead—because they have trained \ntheir minds to be quiet, they have enclosed themselves within a formula for being \nquiet. Obviously, such a mind is never quiet; it is only suppressed, held down. \nThe mind is quiet when it sees the truth that understanding comes only when \nit is quiet; that if I would understand you, I must be quiet, I cannot have reactions \nagainst you, I must not be prejudiced, I must put away all my conclusions, my \nexperiences and meet you face to face. Only then, when the mind is free from my \nconditioning, do I understand. When I see the truth of that, then the mind is \nquiet—and then there is no question of how to make the mind quiet. Only the \ntruth can liberate the mind from its own ideation; to see the truth, the mind must \nrealize the fact that so long as it is agitated it can have no understanding. \nQuietness of mind, tranquillity of mind, is not a thing to be produced by will-\npower, by any action of desire; if it is, then such a mind is enclosed, isolated, it is \na dead mind and therefore incapable of adaptability, of pliability, of swiftness. \nSuch a mind is not creative. \nOur question, then, is not how to make the mind still but to see the truth of \nevery problem as it presents itself to us. It is like the pool that becomes quiet \nwhen the wind stops. Our mind is agitated because we have problems; and to \navoid the problems, we make the mind still. Now the mind has projected these \nproblems and there are no problems apart from the mind; and so long as the mind"

When the mind realizes that only by being still is there understanding—\nthen it becomes very quiet. That quietness is not imposed, not disciplined, it is a \nquietness that cannot be understood by an agitated mind. \nMany who seek quietness of mind withdraw from active life to a village, to a \nmonastery, to the mountains, or they withdraw into ideas, enclose themselves in a \nbelief or avoid people who give them trouble. Such isolation is not stillness of \nmind. The enclosure of the mind in an idea or the avoidance of people who make \nlife complicated does not bring about stillness of mind. Stillness of mind comes \nonly when there is no process of isolation through accumulation but complete \nunderstanding of the whole process of relationship. Accumulation makes the \nmind old; only when the mind is new, when the mind is fresh, without the \nprocess of accumulation—only then is there a possibility of having tranquillity of \nmind.

The still mind is the most active \nmind but if you will experiment with it, go into it deeply, you will see that in \nstillness there is no projection of thought.

Can you tell us the meaning and purpose of our living? \n \nKrishnamurti: Now why do you ask this question? Why are you asking me to tell \nyou the meaning of life, the purpose of life? What do we mean by life? Does life \nhave a meaning, a purpose? Is not living in itself its own purpose, its own \nmeaning? Why do we want more? Because we are so dissatisfied with our life, \nour life is so empty, so tawdry, so monotonous, doing the same thing over and \nover again, we want something more, something beyond that which we are \ndoing. Since our everyday life is so empty, so dull, so meaningless, so boring, so \nintolerably stupid, we say life must have a fuller meaning and that is why you ask \nthis question. Surely a man who is living richly, a man who sees things as they \nare and is content with what he has, is not confused; he is clear, therefore he does \nnot ask what is the purpose of life. For him the very living is the beginning and \nthe end. Our difficulty is that, since our life is empty, we want to find a purpose \nto life and strive for it. Such a purpose of life can only be mere intellection, \nwithout any reality; when the purpose of life is pursued by a stupid, dull mind, by \nan empty heart, that purpose will also be empty. Therefore our purpose is how to \nmake our life rich, not with money and all the rest of it but inwardly rich—which \nis not something cryptic. When you say that the purpose of life is to be happy, \nthe purpose of life is to find God, surely that desire to find God is an escape from \nlife and your God is merely a thing that is known. You can only make your way \ntowards an object which you know; if you build a staircase to the thing that you \ncall God, surely that is not God. Reality can be understood only in living, not in \nescape. When you seek a purpose of life, you are really escaping and not \nunderstanding what life is. Life is relationship, life is action in relationship; when \nI do not understand relationship, or when relationship is confused, then I seek a \nfuller meaning. Why are our lives so empty? Why are we so lonely, frustrated? \nBecause we have never looked into ourselves and understood ourselves. We \nnever admit to ourselves that this life is all we know and that it should therefore \nbe understood fully and completely. We prefer to run away from ourselves and \nthat is why we seek the purpose of life away from relationship. If we begin to \nunderstand action, which is our relationship with people, with property, with \nbeliefs and ideas, then we will find that relationship itself brings its own reward. \nYou do not have to seek. It is like seeking love. Can you find love by seeking it? \nLove cannot be cultivated. You will find love only in relationship, not outside \nrelationship, and it is because we have no love that we want a purpose of life. \nWhen there is love, which is its own eternity, then there is no search for God, \nbecause love is God. \nIt is because our minds are full of technicalities and superstitious mutterings \nthat our lives are so empty and that is why we seek a purpose beyond ourselves. \nTo find life’s purpose we must go through the door of ourselves; consciously or \nunconsciously we avoid facing things as they are in themselves and so we want \nGod to open for us a door which is beyond.

Most \nearnestly I ask you, what can be the purpose of my life if, as you say, all thought \nhas to cease, all knowledge to be suppressed, all memory lost? How do you relate \nthat state of being, whatever it may be according to you, to the world in which \nwe live? What relation has such a being to our sad and painful existence? \n \nKrishnamurti: We want to know what this state is which can only be when all \nknowledge, when the recognizer, is not; we want to know what relationship this \nstate has to our world of daily activity, daily pursuits. We know what our life is \nnow—sad, painful, constantly fearful, nothing permanent; we know that very \nwell. We want to know what relationship this other state has to that—and if we \nput aside knowledge, become free from our memories and so on, what is the \npurpose of existence. \nWhat is the purpose of existence as we know it now?—not theoretically but \nactually? What is the purpose of our everyday existence? Just to survive, isn’t \nit?—with all its misery, with all its sorrow and confusion, wars, destruction and \nso on. We can invent theories, we can say: “This should not be, but something \nelse should be.” But those are all theories, they are not facts. What we know is \nconfusion, pain, suffering, endless antagonisms. We know also, if we are at all \naware, how these come about. The purpose of life, from moment to moment, \nevery day, is to destroy each other, to exploit each other, either as individuals or \nas collective human beings. In our loneliness, in our misery, we try to use others, \nwe try to escape from ourselves—through amusements, through gods, through \nknowledge, through every form of belief, through identification. That is our \npurpose, conscious or unconscious, as we now live. Is there a deeper, wider \npurpose beyond, a purpose that is not of confusion, of acquisition? Has that \neffortless state any relation to our daily life? \nCertainly that has no relation at all to our life. How can it have? If my mind is \nconfused, agonized, lonely, how can that be related to something which is not of \nitself? How can truth be related to falsehood, to illusion? We do not want to \nadmit that, because our hope, our confusion, makes us believe in something \ngreater, nobler, which we say is related to us. In our despair we seek truth, \nhoping that in the discovery of it our despair will disappear. \nSo we can see that a confused mind, a mind ridden with sorrow, a mind that is \naware of its own emptiness, loneliness, can never find that which is beyond itself. \nThat which is beyond the mind can only come into being when the causes of \nconfusion, misery, are dispelled or understood. All that I have been saying, \ntalking about, is how to understand ourselves, for without self-knowledge the \nother is not, the other is only an illusion. If we can understand the total process of \nourselves, from moment to moment, then we shall see that in clearing up our own \nconfusion, the other comes into being. Then experiencing that will have a \nrelation to this. But this will never have a relation to that. Being this side of the \ncurtain, being in darkness, how can one have experience of light, of freedom?"

But when \nonce we have experienced that, then we do not have to bother to find out the \nrelationship. Then love, intelligence, functions. But to experience that state, all \nknowledge, accumulated memories, self-identified activities, must cease, so that \nthe mind is incapable of any projected sensations. Then, experiencing that, there \nis action in this world. \nSurely that is the purpose of existence—to go beyond the self-centred activity \nof the mind. Having experienced that state, which is not measurable by the mind, \nthen the very experiencing of that brings about an inward revolution. Then, if \nthere is love, there is no social problem. There is no problem of any kind when \nthere is love. Because we do not know how to love we have social problems and \nsystems of philosophy on how to deal with our problems. I say these problems \ncan never be solved by any system, either of the left or of the right or of the \nmiddle. They can be solved—our confusion, our misery, our self-destruction—\nonly when we can experience that state which is not self-projected."

    "text": "3 8 .  O N  T R A N S F O R M A T I O N \n \nQuestion: What do you mean by transformation? \n \nKrishnamurti: Obviously, there must be a radical revolution. The world crisis \ndemands it. Our lives demand it. Our everyday incidents, pursuits, anxieties, \ndemand it. Our problems demand it. There must be a fundamental, radical \nrevolution, because everything about us has collapsed. Though seemingly there is \norder, in fact there is slow decay, destruction: the wave of destruction is \nconstantly overtaking the wave of life. \nSo there must be a revolution—but not a revolution based on an idea. Such a \nrevolution is merely the continuation of the idea, not a radical transformation. A \nrevolution based on an idea brings bloodshed, disruption, chaos. Out of chaos \nyou cannot create order; you cannot deliberately bring about chaos and hope to \ncreate order out of that chaos. You are not the God-chosen who are to create \norder out of confusion. That is such a false way of thinking on the part of those \npeople who wish to create more and more confusion in order to bring about \norder. Because for the moment they have power, they assume they know all the \nways of producing order. Seeing the whole of this catastrophe—the constant \nrepetition of wars, the ceaseless conflict between classes, between peoples, the \nawful economic and social inequality, the inequality of capacity and gifts, the \ngulf between those who are extraordinarily happy, unruffled, and those who are \ncaught in hate, conflict, and misery—seeing all this, there must be a revolution, \nthere must be complete transformation, must there not? \nIs this transformation, is this radical revolution, an ultimate thing or is it from \nmoment to moment? I know we should like it to be the ultimate thing, because it \nis so much easier to think in terms of far away. Ultimately we shall be \ntransformed, ultimately we shall be happy, ultimately we shall find truth; in the \nmeantime, let us carry on. Surely such a mind, thinking in terms of the future, is \nincapable of acting in the present; therefore such a mind is not seeking \ntransformation, it is merely avoiding transformation. What do we mean by \ntransformation? \nTransformation is not in the future, can never be in the future. It can only be \nnow, from moment to moment. So what do we mean by transformation? Surely it \nis very simple: seeing the false as the false and the true as the true. Seeing the \ntruth in the false and seeing the false in that which has been accepted as the truth. \nSeeing the false as the false and the true as the true is transformation, because \nwhen you see something very clearly as the truth, that truth liberates. When you \nsee that something is false, that false thing drops away. When you see that \nceremonies are mere vain repetitions, when you see the truth of it and do not \njustify it, there is transformation, is there not?, because another bondage is gone. \nWhen you see that class distinction is false, that it creates conflict, creates \nmisery, division between people—when you see the truth of it, that very truth \nliberates. The very perception of that truth is transformation, is it not? As we are \nsurrounded by so much that is false, perceiving the falseness from moment to \nmoment is transformation. Truth is not cumulative. It is from moment to"

    "text": "moment. That which is cumulative, accumulated, is memory, and through \nmemory you can never find truth, for memory is of time—time being the past, \nthe present and the future. Time, which is continuity, can never find that which is \neternal; eternity is not continuity. That which endures is not eternal. Eternity is in \nthe moment. Eternity is in the now. The now is not the reflection of the past nor \nthe continuance of the past through the present to the future. \nA mind which is desirous of a future transformation or looks to \ntransformation as an ultimate end, can never find truth, for truth is a thing that \nmust come from moment to moment, must be discovered anew; there can be no \ndiscovery through accumulation. How can you discover the new if you have the \nburden of the old? It is only with the cessation of that burden that you discover \nthe new. To discover the new, the eternal, in the present, from moment to \nmoment, one needs an extraordinarily alert mind, a mind that is not seeking a \nresult, a mind that is not becoming. A mind that is becoming can never know the \nfull bliss of contentment; not the contentment of smug satisfaction; not the \ncontentment of an achieved result, but the contentment that comes when the mind \nsees the truth in what is and the false in what is. The perception of that truth is \nfrom moment to moment; and that perception is delayed through verbalization of \nthe moment. \nTransformation is not an end, a result. Transformation is not a result. Result \nimplies residue, a cause and an effect. Where there is causation, there is bound to \nbe effect. The effect is merely the result of your desire to be transformed. When \nyou desire to be transformed, you are still thinking in terms of becoming; that \nwhich is becoming can never know that which is being. Truth is being from \nmoment to moment and happiness that continues is not happiness. Happiness is \nthat state of being which is timeless. That timeless state can come only when \nthere is a tremendous discontent—not the discontent that has found a channel \nthrough which it escapes but the discontent that has no outlet, that has no escape, \nthat is no longer seeking fulfilment. Only then, in that state of supreme \ndiscontent, can reality come into being. That reality is not to be bought, to be \nsold, to be repeated; it cannot be caught in books. It has to be found from \nmoment to moment, in the smile, in the tear, under the dead leaf, in the vagrant \nthoughts, in the fullness of love. \nLove is not different from truth. Love is that state in which the thought \nprocess, as time, has completely ceased. Where love is, there is transformation. \nWithout love, revolution has no meaning, for then revolution is merely \ndestruction, decay, a greater and greater ever-mounting misery. Where there is \nlove, there is revolution, because love is transformation from moment to \nmoment."
