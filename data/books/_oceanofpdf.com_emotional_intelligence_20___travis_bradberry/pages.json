There is something else going on that society doesn’t\nseem to account for.\nWe see examples of this every day in our workplaces, our homes, our\nchurches, our schools and our neighborhoods. We observe supposedly\nbrilliant and well-educated people struggle, while others with fewer obvious\nskills or attributes flourish. And we ask ourselves why?\nThe answer almost always has to do with this concept called emotional\nintelligence. And while it is harder to identify and measure than IQ or\nexperience, and certainly difficult to capture on a resume, it’s power cannot be\ndenied.\nAnd by now, it’s not exactly a secret. People have been talking about\nemotional intelligence for a while, but somehow they haven’t been able to\nharness its power. After all, as a society we continue to focus most of our self-\nimprovement energy in the pursuit of knowledge, experience, intelligence and\neducation. This would be fine if we could honestly say we had a full\nunderstanding of our emotions, not to mention the emotions of others, and an\nunderstanding of how our emotions influence our lives so fundamentally\nevery day.\nI think the reason for this gap between the popularity of emotional\nintelligence as a concept and its application in society is twofold.

It was the first day of a long\nholiday weekend, and a perfect morning to grab his board and head out for a\nsurf. Most of the other local surfers had the same idea that morning, and after\n30 minutes or so, Butch decided to leave the crowd behind. He penetrated the\nwater’s surface with long, deep strokes that propelled him away from the pack\nand over to a stretch of beach where he could catch a few waves away from\nthe crowd.\nOnce Butch had paddled a good 40 yards away from the other surfers, he\nsat up on his board and bobbed up and down in the rolling swells while he\nwaited for a wave that caught his fancy. A beautiful teal wave began to crest\nas it approached the shoreline, and as Butch lay down on his board to catch\nthe wave, a loud splash behind him stole his attention. Butch glanced over his\nright shoulder and froze in horror at the sight of a 14-inch, gray dorsal fin\ncutting through the water toward him. Butch’s muscles locked up, and he lay\nthere in a panic, gasping for air. He became hyper-focused on his\nsurroundings; he could hear his heart pounding as he watched the sun\nglistening on the fin’s moist surface.\nThe approaching wave stood tall to reveal Butch’s worst nightmare\nin the shimmering, translucent surface—a massive great white shark\nthat stretched 14 feet from nose to tail.\n \nThe approaching wave stood tall to reveal Butch’s worst nightmare in the\nshimmering, translucent surface—a massive great white shark that stretched\n14 feet from nose to tail.

The shark drifted in slowly along his left side, and\nhe was too transfixed by the proximity of the massive fish to notice his left\nleg dangling perilously off his surfboard in the frigid saltwater. It’s as big\naround as my Volkswagen, Butch thought as the dorsal fin approached. He felt\nthe sudden urge to reach out and touch the shark. It’s going to kill me anyway.\nWhy shouldn’t I touch it?\nThe shark didn’t give him a chance. The shark, with a massive chomp of its\njaws, thrust its head upward from underneath Butch’s leg. Butch’s leg stayed\non top of the shark’s rising, boulder-sized head and out of its cavernous\nmouth, and he fell off the opposite side of his surfboard into the murky water.\nButch splashing into the water sent the shark into a spastic frenzy. The shark\nwaved its head about maniacally while snapping its jaws open and shut. The\ngreat white struck nothing; it blasted water in all directions as it thrashed\nabout. The irony of floating alongside a 3,000-pound killing machine without\nso much as a scratch was not lost on Butch. Neither was the grave reality that\nthis apex predator was unlikely to miss again. Thoughts of escape and\nsurvival flooded Butch’s mind as quickly and completely as terror had in the\nmoments prior.\nThe shark stopped snapping and swam around Butch in tight circles.\nInstead of climbing back on his surfboard, Butch floated on his belly with his\narms draped over the board. He rotated the surfboard as the shark circled,\nusing the surfboard as a makeshift barrier between himself and the man-eater.\nButch’s fear morphed into anger as he waited for the beast to strike. The shark\ncame at him again, and Butch decided it was time to put up a fight. He aimed\nthe sharp, pointed nose of his surfboard at the shark as it approached. When it\nraised its head out of the water to bite, Butch jammed the nose of the board\ninto the shark’s slotted gills. This blow sent the shark into another bout of\nnervous thrashing. Butch climbed atop his board and yelled, “Shark!” at the\npack of surfers down the beach. Butch’s warning and the sight of the turbulent\ncauldron of white-water around him sent the surfers racing for dry land.\nButch also paddled toward safety, but the shark stopped him dead in his\ntracks after just a few strokes. It surfaced in his path to the shoreline, and then\nbegan circling him once more. Butch came to the dire conclusion that his\nevasive tactics were merely delaying the inevitable, and a paralyzing fear took\nhold of him yet again.

He wanted to escape\nthis monster, and he needed to calm down if that was ever going to happen.\nButch convinced himself that the shark could sense his fear like a rabid dog;\nhe decided that he must get hold of himself because it was his fear that was\nmotivating the shark to strike. To Butch’s surprise, his body listened. The\ntrembling subsided, and the blood returned to his arms and legs. He felt\nstrong. He was ready to paddle. And paddle Butch did—straight for the\nshoreline. A healthy rip current ensured that his journey to shore was a nerve-\nrattling five minutes of paddling like mad with the sense that the shark was\nsomewhere behind him and could strike at any moment. When Butch made it\nto the beach, an awestruck group of surfers and other beachgoers were\nwaiting for him. The surfers thanked him profusely for the warning and patted\nhim on the back.

    "text": "WHEN REASON AND FEELING COLLIDE\nButch and the great white weren’t fighting the only battle in the water that\nmorning. Deep inside Butch’s brain, his reason struggled for control of his\nbehavior against an onslaught of intense emotions. The bulk of the time, his\nfeelings won out, which was mostly to his detriment (paralyzing fear) but at\ntimes a benefit (the anger-fueled jab of his surfboard). With great effort,\nButch was able to calm himself down, and—realizing the shark wasn’t going\naway—make the risky paddle for shore that saved his life. Though most of us\nwill never have to tussle with a great white shark, our brains battle it out like\nButch’s every single day.\nThe daily challenge of dealing effectively with emotions is critical to the\nhuman condition because our brains are hard-wired to give emotions the\nupper hand. Here’s how it works: everything you see, smell, hear, taste and\ntouch travels through your body in the form of electric signals. These signals\npass from cell to cell until they reach their ultimate destination, your brain.\nThey enter your brain at the base near the spinal cord, but must travel to your\nfrontal lobe (behind your forehead) before reaching the place where rational,\nlogical thinking takes place. The trouble is, they pass through your limbic\nsystem along the way—the place where emotions are produced. This journey\nensures you experience things emotionally before your reason can kick into\ngear.\nThe rational area of your brain (the front of your brain) can’t stop the\nemotion “felt” by your limbic system, but the two areas do influence each\nother and maintain constant communication. The communication between\nyour emotional and rational “brains” is the physical source of emotional\nintelligence."

    "text": "2\nTHE BIG PICTURE\nBefore you take a closer look at each of the four EQ skills in the next chapter,\nthere are some important things you need to know about EQ as a whole. Over\nthe last decade we’ve tested more than 500,000 people to explore the role\nemotions play in daily living. We’ve learned how people see themselves\nversus what others see, and we’ve observed how various choices affect\npersonal and professional success.\nDespite the growing focus on EQ, a global deficit in understanding and\nmanaging emotions remains. Only 36 percent of the people we tested are able\nto accurately identify their emotions as they happen. This means that two\nthirds of us are typically controlled by our emotions and are not yet skilled at\nspotting them and using them to our benefit. Emotional awareness and\nunderstanding are not taught in school. We enter the workforce knowing how\nto read, write, and report on bodies of knowledge, but too often, we lack the\nskills to manage our emotions in the heat of the challenging problems that we\nface. Good decisions require far more than factual knowledge. They are made\nusing self-knowledge and emotional mastery when they’re needed most.\nOnly 36 percent of the people we tested are able to accurately\nidentify their emotions as they happen.\n \nConsidering the range of emotions people express, it’s no wonder they can\nget the better of us. We have so many words to describe the feelings that\nsurface in life, yet all emotions are derivations of five core feelings:\nhappiness, sadness, anger, fear, and shame. As you move through your daily\nroutine—whether you’re working, spending time with family or friends,\neating, exercising, relaxing, or even sleeping—you are subject to a constant\nstream of emotions. It is so easy to forget that we have emotional reactions to\nalmost everything that happens in our lives, whether we notice them or not."

    "text": "Triggers and Emotional Hijackings\nWhile Butch Connor was being attacked by a great white shark, he\nexperienced several emotional hijackings—moments when his emotions\ncontrolled his behavior and he reacted without thinking. Typically, the more\nintense your emotions are, the greater the likelihood that they will dictate your\nactions. Matters of life or death—such as being attacked by a massive beast—\nare certain to induce a temporary emotional hijacking.\nIn Butch’s case, emotional hijackings left him paralyzed by fear, but even\nin the presence of a man-eater, Butch was able to use his thoughts to take\nback control from his emotions. Butch reasoned with himself until the\nparalysis subsided and he was calm enough to complete the paddle to shore.\nButch’s thoughts didn’t make his feelings of fear and terror disappear, but\nthey did keep his emotions from hijacking his behavior.\nSince our brains are wired to make us emotional creatures, your first\nreaction to an event is always going to be an emotional one. You have no\ncontrol over this part of the process. You do control the thoughts that follow\nan emotion, and you have a great deal of say in how you react to an emotion\n—as long as you are aware of it. Some experiences produce emotions that you\nare easily aware of; other times, emotions may seem nonexistent. When\nsomething generates a prolonged emotional reaction in you, it’s called a\n“trigger event.” Your reaction to your triggers is shaped by your personal\nhistory, which includes your experience with similar situations. As your EQ\nskills grow, you’ll learn to spot your triggers and practice productive ways of\nresponding that will become habitual."

    "text": "Sizing Up the Whole Person\nEmotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in\nyourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your\nbehavior and relationships. Emotional intelligence is the “something” in each\nof us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate\nsocial complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results.\nEmotional intelligence taps into a fundamental element of human behavior\nthat is distinct from your intellect. There is no known connection between IQ\nand EQ; you simply can’t predict EQ based on how smart someone is.\nCognitive intelligence, or IQ, is not flexible. Your IQ, short of a traumatic\nevent such as a brain injury, is fixed from birth. You don’t get smarter by\nlearning new facts or information. Intelligence is your ability to learn, and it’s\nthe same at age 15 as it is at age 50. EQ, on the other hand, is a flexible skill\nthat can be learned. While it is true that some people are naturally more\nemotionally intelligent than others, a high EQ can be developed even if you\naren’t born with it.\nPersonality is the final piece in the puzzle. It’s the stable “style” that\ndefines each of us. Your personality is a result of your preferences, such as\nyour inclination to introversion or extroversion. However, like IQ, personality\ncan’t be used to predict emotional intelligence. Also like IQ, personality is\nstable over a lifetime. Personality traits appear early in life, and they don’t go\naway. People often assume that certain traits (for example, extroversion) are\nassociated with a higher EQ, but those who prefer to be with other people are\nno more emotionally intelligent than people who prefer to be alone. You can\nuse your personality to assist in developing your EQ, but the latter isn’t\ndependent on the former. EQ is a flexible skill, while personality does not\nchange. IQ, EQ, and personality assessed together are the best way to get a\npicture of the whole person. When you measure all three in a single\nindividual, they don’t overlap much. Instead, each covers unique ground that\nhelps to explain what makes a person tick."

Of the three, EQ is\nthe only quality that is flexible and able to change."

On the flip side, just 20 percent of low\nperformers are high in EQ. You can be a high performer without EQ, but the\nchances are slim. People who develop their EQ tend to be successful on the\njob because the two go hand in hand.

The link between EQ and earnings is so direct that every point increase\nin EQ adds $1,300 to an annual salary.

    "text": "Self-Awareness\nSelf-awareness is your ability to accurately perceive your own emotions in the\nmoment and understand your tendencies across situations. Self-awareness\nincludes staying on top of your typical reactions to specific events,\nchallenges, and people. A keen understanding of your tendencies is important;\nit helps you quickly make sense of your emotions. A high degree of self-\nawareness requires a willingness to tolerate the discomfort of focusing on\nfeelings that may be negative.\nThe only way to genuinely understand your emotions is to spend enough\ntime thinking through them to figure out where they come from and why they\nare there. Emotions always serve a purpose. Because they are reactions to\nyour life experience, emotions always come from somewhere. Many times\nemotions seem to arise out of thin air, and it’s important to understand why\nsomething gets a reaction out of you. People who do this can cut to the core of\na feeling quickly. Situations that create strong emotions will always require\nmore thought, and these prolonged periods of self-reflection often keep you\nfrom doing something that you’ll regret.\nSelf-awareness is not about discovering deep, dark secrets or unconscious\nmotivations, but, rather, it comes from developing a straightforward and\nhonest understanding of what makes you tick. People high in self-awareness\nare remarkably clear in their understanding of what they do well, what\nmotivates and satisfies them, and which people and situations push their\nbuttons.\nThe surprising thing about self-awareness is that just thinking about it helps\nyou improve the skill, even though much of your focus initially tends to be on\nwhat you do “wrong.” Having self-awareness means you aren’t afraid of your\nemotional “mistakes.” They tell you what you should be doing differently and\nprovide the steady stream of information you need to understand as your life\nunfolds."

Self-awareness is so\nimportant for job performance that 83 percent of people high in self-\nawareness are top performers, and just 2 percent of bottom performers are\nhigh in self-awareness. Why is this so? When you are self-aware you are far\nmore likely to pursue the right opportunities, put your strengths to work and\n—perhaps most importantly—keep your emotions from holding you back.\nThe need for self-awareness has never been greater. Guided by the\nmistaken notion that psychology deals exclusively with pathology, we assume\nthat the only time to learn about ourselves is in the face of crisis. We tend to\nembrace those things with which we’re comfortable, and put the blinders on\nthe moment something makes us uncomfortable. But it’s really the whole\npicture that serves us. The more we understand the beauty and the blemishes,\nthe better we are able to achieve our full potential."

Self-management is your ability to use your awareness of your\nemotions to stay flexible and direct your behavior positively. This means\nmanaging your emotional reactions to situations and people. Some emotions\ncreate a paralyzing fear that makes your thinking so cloudy that the best\ncourse of action is nowhere to be found—assuming that there is something\nyou should be doing. In these cases, self-management is revealed by your\nability to tolerate the uncertainty as you explore your emotions and options.\nOnce you understand and build comfort with what you are feeling, the best\ncourse of action will show itself.\nSelf-management is more than resisting explosive or problematic behavior.\nThe biggest challenge that people face is managing their tendencies over time\nand applying their skills in a variety of situations. Obvious and momentary\nopportunities for self-control (i.e., “I’m so mad at that darn dog!”) are the\neasiest to spot and manage. Real results come from putting your momentary\nneeds on hold to pursue larger, more important goals.

This\nensures clear communication and effective handling of conflict. Relationship\nmanagement is also the bond you build with others over time. People who\nmanage relationships well are able to see the benefit of connecting with many\ndifferent people, even those they are not fond of. Solid relationships are\nsomething that should be sought and cherished. They are the result of how\nyou understand people, how you treat them, and the history you share.\nThe weaker the connection you have with someone, the harder it is to get\nyour point across. If you want people to listen, you have to practice\nrelationship management and seek benefits from every relationship, especially\nthe challenging ones. The difference between an interaction and a relationship\nis a matter of frequency. It’s a product of the quality, depth, and time you\nspend interacting with another person.\nRelationship management poses the greatest challenge for most people\nduring times of stress. When you consider that more than 70 percent of the\npeople we’ve tested have difficulty handling stress, it’s easy to see why\nbuilding quality relationships poses a challenge. Some of the most\nchallenging and stressful situations people face are at work. Conflicts at work\ntend to fester when people passively avoid problems, because people lack the\nskills needed to initiate a direct, yet constructive conversation.

Your EQ\nis greatly affected by your ability to keep this road well traveled. The more\nyou think about what you are feeling—and do something productive with that\nfeeling—the more developed this pathway becomes. Some of us struggle\nalong a two-lane country road, while others have built a five-lane\nsuperhighway. Whether the former or the latter best describes you, there’s\nalways room to add lanes.\n“Plasticity” is the term neurologists use to describe the brain’s ability to\nchange. Your brain grows new connections much as your biceps might swell\nif you started curling heavy weights several times a week. The change is\ngradual, and the weight becomes easier and easier to lift the longer you stick\nto your routine. Your brain can’t swell like your biceps since it’s confined by\nyour skull, so instead the brain cells develop new connections to speed the\nefficiency of thought without increasing its size.\nAs you apply the strategies from the remaining chapters to increase your\nEQ skills, the billions of microscopic neurons lining the road between the\nrational and emotional centers of your brain will branch off small “arms”\n(much like a tree branch) to reach out to the other cells. A single cell can grow\n15,000 connections with its neighbors.

    "text": "5\nSELF-AWARENESS STRATEGIES\nSimply put, to be self-aware is to know yourself as you really are. Initially,\nself-awareness can come across as a somewhat ambiguous concept. There is\nno finish line where someone is going to slap a medal on you and deem you\n“self-aware.” In addition, awareness of yourself is not just knowing that you\nprefer oranges over apples or telling people that you are a morning person\ninstead of a night owl. It’s deeper than that. Getting to know yourself inside\nand out is a continuous journey of peeling back the layers of the onion and\nbecoming more and more comfortable with what is in the middle—the true\nessence of you.\nYour hard-wired emotional reactions to anything come before you even\nhave a chance to respond. Since it isn’t possible to leave your emotions out of\nthe equation, managing yourself and your relationships means you first need\nto be aware of the full range of your feelings, both positive and negative.\nWhen you don’t take time out to notice and understand your emotions, they\nhave a strange way of resurfacing when you least expect or want them to. It’s\ntheir way of trying to bring something important to your attention. They will\npersist, and the damage will mount, until you take notice.\nFacing the truth about who you are can at times be unsettling. Getting in\ntouch with your emotions and tendencies takes honesty and courage. Be\npatient and give yourself credit for even the smallest bits of forward\nmomentum. As you start noticing things about yourself that you weren’t\npreviously aware of (things you aren’t always going to like), you are\nprogressing.\nThe remainder of this chapter introduces you to 15 original strategies,\nwhich were designed to help you maximize your self-awareness to create"

    "text": "Quit Treating Your Feelings as Good or Bad\nIt’s human nature to want to create two simple and easy piles of emotions: the\ngood ones and the bad ones. For instance, most people would automatically\nclassify guilt as bad. You don’t want to feel it—you might even beat yourself\nup about it—and you do whatever you can to get rid of it. Likewise, we tend\nto let good emotions like excitement run wild. We pump ourselves up and\nfeed off the energy.\nSuspending judgment of emotions allows them to run their course\nand vanish.\n \nThe downfall of attaching such labels to your emotions is that judging your\nemotions keeps you from really understanding what it is that you are feeling.\nWhen you allow yourself to sit with an emotion and become fully aware of it,\nyou can understand what is causing it. Suspending judgment of emotions\nallows them to run their course and vanish. Passing judgment on whether you\nshould or shouldn’t be feeling what you are feeling just heaps more emotions\non top of the pile and prevents the original feeling from running its course.\nSo, the next time you feel an emotion begin to build, take notice of it\nimmediately. Refrain from putting it into the good or bad pile and remind\nyourself that the feeling is there to help you understand something important."

The\nstone’s swift plummet pierces the water’s surface, sending ripples in all\ndirections. Your outpourings of emotion are like stones that send ripples\nthrough the people in your life. Since emotions are the primary drivers of\nyour behavior, it’s important you understand the effect they have on other\npeople.\nLet’s say a manager loses his cool and berates an employee in front of the\nrest of the team. When the lashing happens, it may seem that the manager’s\ntarget is the only one whose feelings get bruised, but the ripple effect from the\nmanager’s explosion affects all who witnessed it. As the rest of the team\nmembers wander back to their desks, the others, too, feel the manager’s\nwrath. They go back to work with a pit in their stomachs, each one wondering\nwhen his or her turn will come up.\nThe manager thinks his tirade was good for productivity because the rant\n“scared people straight,” but their fear soon settles into caution. To perform at\ntheir best, the team members need to take risks, stretch themselves beyond\ntheir comfort zone, and even make some mistakes along the way. No one on\nthe team wants to be the manager’s next target, so the team members play it\nsafe and do only as they are told. When the manager gets docked a year later\nfor leading a team that fails to take initiative, he wonders what’s wrong with\nthe team.\nYour emotions are powerful weapons, and continuing to think that their\neffects are instant and minimal will only do you a disservice. The key to\nobserving the ripple effects of your emotions is to watch closely how they\nimpact other people immediately, and then use that information as a guide for\nhow your emotions are bound to affect a wider circle long after you unleash\nthe emotion. To fully understand the ripple effects of your emotions, you’ll\nneed to spend some time reflecting upon your behavior. You’ll also need to"

Avoiding this pain creates problems, because it is merely a\nshort-term fix. You’ll never be able to manage yourself effectively if you\nignore what you need to do to change.\nRather than avoiding a feeling, your goal should be to move toward\nthe emotion, into it, and eventually through it.\n \nRather than avoiding a feeling, your goal should be to move toward the\nemotion, into it, and eventually through it. This can be said for even mild\nemotional discomfort, such as boredom, confusion, or anticipation. When you\nignore or minimize an emotion, no matter how small or insignificant, you\nmiss the opportunity to do something productive with that feeling. Even\nworse, ignoring your feelings does not make them go away; it just helps them\nto surface again when you least expect them.\nTo be effective in life, we all need to discover our own arrogance—those\nthings we don’t bother to learn about and dismiss as unimportant. One person\nthinks apologies are for sissies, so she never learns to recognize when one is\nneeded. Another person hates feeling down, so he constantly distracts himself\nwith meaningless activity and never really feels content. Both people need to\ntake the bold step of leaning into the feelings that will motivate them to\nchange. Otherwise, they will continue down an unproductive, unsatisfying\npath, repeating the same patterns over and over again.\nAfter the first few times you lean into your discomfort, you will quickly\nfind that the discomfort isn’t so bad, it doesn’t ruin you, and it reaps rewards."

The physical sensations can be\nas varied as your stomach muscles tightening, your heart rate increasing, your\nbreathing quickening, or your mouth going dry. Because your mind and body\nare so tightly connected, one of the most effective ways to understand your\nemotions as they are happening is to learn how to spot the physical changes\nthat accompany your emotions.\nTo better understand the physical effects of your emotions, try closing your\neyes the next time you have a few moments alone. Feel how fast or slow your\nheart is beating. Notice the pace of your breathing. Determine how tense or\nrelaxed the muscles are in your arms, legs, neck, and back. Now, think of a\ncouple of events from your life—one positive and one negative—that\ngenerate strong emotions. Think through one of these events in enough detail\nthat you can feel your emotions stir. Take note of the physical changes that\naccompany the feelings. Do they make your breathing or heart rate change?\nDo your muscles grow tense? Do you feel hotter or colder? Repeat this\nprocess with the other event, and take note of the physical differences in the\nemotions from the positive and negative experiences.\nClosing your eyes and thinking of emotionally arousing events is simply\ntraining for the real thing—spotting the physical signs of your emotions on\nthe fly. In the beginning, try not to think too hard—simply open your mind to\nnoticing the sensations.

On the surface, it may seem that self-\nmanagement is simply a matter of taking a deep breath and keeping yourself\nin check when emotions come on strong, and while it’s true that self-control\nin these situations is a sizeable piece of the pie, there’s far more to self-\nmanagement than putting a cork in it when you’re about to blow up. Your\neruptions are no different from a volcano—there is all sorts of rumbling\nhappening beneath the surface before the lava starts flowing.\nUnlike a volcano, there are subtle things you can do each and every day to\ninfluence what is happening beneath the surface. You just need to learn how\nto pick up on the rumbling and respond to it. Self-management builds upon a\nfoundational skill—self-awareness. Ample self-awareness is necessary for\neffective self-management because you can only choose how to respond to an\nemotion actively when you’re aware of it. Since we’re hard-wired to\nexperience emotions before we can respond to them, it’s the one-two punch of\nreading emotions effectively and then reacting to them that sets the best self-\nmanagers apart. A high level of self-management ensures you aren’t getting in\nyour own way and doing things that limit your success. It also ensures you\naren’t frustrating other people to the point that they resent or dislike you.\nWhen you understand your own emotions and can respond the way you\nchoose to them, you have the power to take control of difficult situations,\nreact nimbly to change, and take the initiative needed to achieve your goals.\nWhen you develop the ability to size yourself up quickly and grab the reins\nbefore you head in the wrong direction, it keeps you flexible and allows you\nto choose positively and productively how to react to different situations.\nWhen you don’t stop to think about your feelings—including how they are\ninfluencing your behavior now, and will continue to do so in the future—you\nset yourself up to be a frequent victim of emotional hijackings.

What’s to stop you? It’s not like you are suffering from\nthe lack of oxygen . . . or so you think. Your lungs are built to provide\nprecisely the amount of air your body needs for all of your organs to function\neffectively. When you take shallow breaths—which is any breath that fails to\nmake your stomach protrude outward from the influx of air—you aren’t\ngiving your body the full amount of oxygen it needs.\nYour brain demands a full 20 percent of your body’s oxygen supply, which\nit needs to control basic functions like breathing and sight and complex\nfunctions like thinking and managing your mood. Your brain dedicates\noxygen first to the basic functions, because they keep you alive. Whatever\noxygen remains is used for the complex functions, which keep you alert,\nfocused, and calm. Shallow breaths deprive your brain of oxygen, which can\nlead to poor concentration, forgetfulness, mood swings, restlessness,\ndepressed and anxious thoughts, and a lack of energy. Shallow breathing\nhandicaps your ability to self-manage.\nThe next time you are in a stressful or emotional situation, focus on taking\nslow deep breaths, inhaling through your nose until you can feel your stomach\nswell outward and grow tight, and then exhaling gently and completely\nthrough your mouth.

If you want to make sure that you\nare breathing correctly, place one hand upon your sternum (the long, flat bone\nlocated in the center of your chest) and the other hand upon your stomach as\nyou take in breaths.

When you’re stuck on a frustrating or distressing\nthought, forcing yourself to smile counteracts the negative emotional state. If\nyou work in customer service, or any time you need to look upbeat when\nyou’re really not up for it, making yourself throw on a large, legitimate smile\n(where your cheeks push upwards) will trick your mind into feeling the mood\nyou need for the moment.\nFrench university researchers measured the power of a smile by having two\ngroups of subjects read the same comics page from the newspaper. One group\nof subjects was instructed to hold a pencil in their teeth while reading (which\nactivates the muscles used in smiling), while the other group held the pencil\nwith their lips (which does not activate the muscles used in smiling).

You can help this along and improve the quality of your sleep\nby following these steps for good sleep hygiene:\n1. Get twenty minutes of morning sunlight. Your eyes need at least\ntwenty minutes of pre-noon sunlight (cloudy days are fine) to reset\nyour inner clock, which makes it easier to fall asleep in the evening.\nThe light can’t be filtered by windows or sunglasses. So, take the\nglasses off and crack your car windows on the way to work, or find\nsome time to get outdoors before lunch-time.\n2. Turn off the computer at least two hours before bedtime. The light\nof a computer screen right in front of your face late at night is similar\nenough to sunlight that it tricks your brain, making it difficult to fall\nasleep and disruptive to the quality of your sleep.\n3. Keep your bed for sleeping. The best way to check out the moment\nyou hit the mattress is to avoid working or watching television in bed.\nSave your bed for sleep and your body will respond.\n4. Avoid caffeine, especially in the p.m. Caffeine has a six-hour half-\nlife. Have a cup of joe at eight a.m., and you’ll still have 25 percent of\nthe caffeine in your body at eight p.m. Caffeine keeps you from falling\nasleep and is extremely disruptive to the quality of your sleep. It’s best\navoided all together, or at least taken in small amounts and only before\nnoon."

The\nbiggest clue that someone is lying occurs when synchrony—body language\nthat matches the emotions being expressed—is absent.\nSynchrony is also an important tool for effective self-managers. When you\nare doing a good job of managing your emotions, your body language will fit\nthe emotional tone of the situation. When you can’t keep your body language\nin check, it is a clear sign that your emotions are getting the best of you.\nWhen a commercial airliner crash-landed safely in New York’s Hudson\nRiver in 2009, the pilot, Chelsea “Sully” Sullenberger, saved every soul\nonboard by making sure the plane hit the water at the exact angle and speed\nneeded to avoid breaking up upon impact.

He kept his emotions from taking the controls, even though he knew\nthe chances for survival were slim.\nOn most days, you won’t be crash-landing airplanes, but, if you’re like\nmost people, you’ll have moments where your emotions are getting the better\nof you.

Use\nthis person as a sounding board for what you’ve experienced and what you\nare thinking and feeling about the troubling situation. Their unique\nperspective will help you to see things differently, and expand your options.\nChoose your third party wisely. The people you invite to help you shouldn’t\nhave a vested interest in the situation.

Next, to squelch the voice that is planning your\nresponse, it’s important to catch yourself in the act; and when you do, stop\nyourself and clear away the clutter.

Believe it or not, Hollywood is also a hotbed of EQ,\nripe for building your social awareness skills.\nAfter all, art imitates life, right? Movies are an abundant source of EQ\nskills in action, demonstrating behaviors to emulate or completely avoid.\nGreat actors are masters at evoking real emotion in themselves; as their\ncharacters are scripted to do outrageous and obvious things, it’s easy to\nobserve the cues and emotions on-screen.\nTo build social awareness skills, you need to practice being aware of what’s\nhappening with other people; it doesn’t matter if you practice using a box\noffice hero or a real person. When you watch a movie to observe social cues,\nyou’re practicing social awareness. Plus, since you are not living the situation,\nyou’re not emotionally involved, and the distractions are limited. You can use\nyour mental energy to observe the characters instead of dealing with your\nown life.\nThis month, make it a point to watch two movies specifically to observe the\ncharacter interactions, relationships, and conflicts. Look for body language\nclues to figure out how each character is feeling and observe how the\ncharacters handle the conflicts. As more information about the characters\nunfold, rewind and watch past moments to spot clues you may have missed\nthe first time. Believe it or not, watching movies from the land of make-\nbelieve is one of the most useful and entertaining ways to practice your social\nawareness skills for the real world."

Most people think they are good\nlisteners, but if adults played “the Telephone Game” today, how accurate\nwould the final message be? Listening requires focus, and focus isn’t easy\nbecause we’re stretched in several directions.\nListening isn’t just about hearing words; it’s also about listening to the\ntone, speed, and volume of the voice. What is being said? Anything not being\nsaid? What hidden messages exist below the surface? You may have sat\nthrough a speech or presentation where powerful words were chosen, but the\ntone, speed, or volume didn’t match the power of the words. Instead, these\nlikely matched the speaker’s frame of mind.\nHere’s the strategy to practice: when someone is talking to you, stop\neverything else and listen fully until the other person is finished speaking.\nWhen you are on a phone call, don’t type an email. When your son asks you a\nquestion, put your laptop down and look at him while you respond. When\nyou’re eating dinner with your family, turn off the TV and listen to the\nconversation around the table. When you’re meeting with someone, close the\ndoor and sit near the person so you can focus and listen.

Maintaining relationships may not be on your job\ndescription and may not have even been discussed, but for you to be\nsuccessful, being open and curious is absolutely, unequivocally part of your\njob.\nLet’s explore what “open” means in terms of relationship management.\nBeing open means sharing information about yourself with others. You can\nuse your self-management skills to choose how open you are and what you\nshare, but know that there’s a benefit to opening up that may help you with\nyour choices: when people know about you, there’s less room for them to\nmisinterpret you. For example, if you are particularly sensitive about showing\nup five minutes early to meetings, and get annoyed when people stroll in at\nthe very beginning of the meeting or even a little late, some people might\ninterpret you as being uptight and rigid. If you shared with these same people\nthat you were in the Marines for the first years of your career, your coworkers\nwould understand and maybe even appreciate your sense of timing and\ncourtesy. Who knows, your punctuality might even rub off!\nBeing an open book on your end isn’t the whole story with managing a\nrelationship—you also need to be interested in the other person’s story as\nwell. In other words, you need to be curious. The more you show interest in\nand learn about the other person, the better shot you have at meeting his or\nher needs and not misinterpreting them.\nWhen you ask questions, draw from your social awareness skills to choose\nan appropriate setting and time.

Use your self-awareness skills to identify how the policy works for\nyou, and manage yourself to make it work. Ongoing observations of others,\nalso known as social awareness, should help you determine how it’s working,\ntoo.\nRemember, increasing your accessibility can only improve your\nrelationships—it literally opens the door to communication, even if it’s virtual\n(by email or phone). People will feel valued and respected because of the time\nyou’re giving them; and you get the opportunity to learn about others. At the\nend of the day, the policy’s a win for you and a win for others."

But to be angry with the right\nperson, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the\nright way, this is not easy.”\nWe can thank Greek philosopher Aristotle for those words and enduring\ninsight into managing our emotions and relationships. If you can master this\none, consider your EQ journey a success. Anger is an emotion that exists for a\nreason—anger is not an emotion to stifle or ignore. If you manage it properly\nand use it purposefully, you can get results that enhance your relationships.\nReally.\nThink of the football coach who gets straight to the point at halftime. His\nstern feedback grabs his players’ attention and focuses them for the second\nhalf. The team returns refreshed, refocused, and ready to win; in this case, the\ncoach managed his emotions to motivate others to action. Expressing anger in\nappropriate ways communicates your strong feelings and reminds people of\nthe gravity of a situation. Expressing anger too much or at the wrong times\ndesensitizes people to what you are feeling, making it hard for others to take\nyou seriously.\nUsing a strong emotion like anger to benefit your relationships will take\ntime to master, because hopefully you don’t have daily opportunities to\npractice. There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes preparation for this strategy,\nstarting with becoming aware of your anger.\nUse your self-awareness skills to think about and define your varying\ndegrees of anger—from what annoys you a little to what sends you off the\ndeep end. Write these down and choose words that are specific and then write\nexamples to explain when you feel this way. Determine when you should\nshow your anger based on the criterion that if it’s shared it will actually"

You ask her if she’s OK,\nand she’s not. You respond with, “Well, work will get it off your mind.

Everyone has a right to experience\nfeelings, even if you might not feel the same way.

Using\nyour social awareness skills, listen to her intently and summarize what you’ve\nheard back to her. Not only does it show great listening skills, but it also\nshows that you’re adept at relationship management because you reached out\nto show you cared, and took an interest in her.

    "text": "Federal economists pinpointed December 2007 as the start of the United\nStates’ worst economy in 70 years, which means that 2008 did not see a single\nday without recession. The relapse in emotional intelligence skills between\n2007 and 2008 is the product of economic woes. Hard times of any kind—\nfinancial, familial, or job-related—create more intense and often prolonged\nnegative emotions that ultimately result in stress. In addition to the physical\ncosts of stress, such as weight gain and heart disease, stress also taxes our\nmental resources. Under stress-free conditions, we can consciously devote\nextra effort to staying calm and collected during the trials and tribulations of\neveryday life. We are more confident in our abilities to handle unexpected\nevents, and we allow our minds to overcome troublesome matters.\nUnmanaged stress, however, consumes much of those mental resources. It\nreduces our minds to something like a state of martial law in which emotions\nsingle-handedly dictate behavior, while our rational capacities are busy trying\nto turn lemons into lemonade. Suddenly, a little setback in your project at\nwork that would have been no big deal in relatively prosperous times feels\nmore like a catastrophe than a minor nuisance. For many people, their EQ\nskills desert them at precisely the time when they need these skills the most—\nunder stress. Only those with well-trained and almost second-nature EQ skills\ncan effectively weather the storm.\nIn other words, we lost 2.8 million highly skilled soldiers in the battle\nfor a more emotionally intelligent society.\n \nThis stress seems to be having a significant impact on our collective\nemotional intelligence. We went from 18.3% of people being highly skilled in\nemotional intelligence in 2007 to only 16.7% in 2008. In other words, we lost\n2.8 million highly skilled soldiers in the battle for a more emotionally\nintelligent society. That is 2.8 million people who could have been guideposts\nshowing others the way to more emotionally intelligent behaviors, but are\ninstead struggling to keep their own skills sharp."

It only took a few years of dazzling clients and\ngarnering rave reviews from upper management before she was eventually\nsnatched up by her current employer—a large regional healthcare system in\nthe Midwest. Still in her early 30s, Sheila is already an assistant vice president\non the fast track to a C-level appointment. Her past and current superiors\nunanimously agree that Sheila is “smart,” yet there is something else—\nsomething they can’t quite put a finger on. Early in Sheila’s consulting career,\nafter watching her defuse tense situations with clients time and again, her\nformer manager summed up the secret to Sheila’s success: She just “gets\npeople.”\nIn 2003, we found some stark contrasts between the EQ skills expressed by\nmen and those found in women like Sheila. Women outperformed men in\nself-management, social awareness, and relationship management. In fact,\nself-awareness was the only EQ skill in which men were able to keep pace\nwith women.\nBut times have changed, and so have men.\nAs the graph shows, men and women are still neck and neck in their ability\nto recognize their own emotions—just as in 2003. But men have caught up in\ntheir ability to manage their own emotions. Chalk this change up to nothing\nmore than shifting social norms.\nThis evolution of cultural mores benefits men. Men are now encouraged to\npay their emotions some extra thought, which goes a long way toward clearer\nthinking. Not surprisingly, we found that a full 70% of male leaders who rank\nin the top 15% in decision-making skills also score the highest in emotional\nintelligence skills. In contrast, not one single male leader with low EQ was\namong \nthe \nmost \nskilled \ndecision \nmakers. \nAlthough \nthis \nseems\ncounterintuitive, it turns out that paying attention to your emotions is the most\nlogical way to make good decisions. So instead of feeling like time spent\naddressing angst or frustration is somehow a sign of weakness, men are now\nfree to get a stronger handle on their emotions in the name of sound judgment.\nGENDER DIFFERENCES IN EQ"

We have measured EQ in half a million\nsenior executives (including 1,000 CEOs), managers, and line employees\nacross industries on six continents.

Boomers hold the majority of top\nleadership roles in the workplace, and their retirement creates a leadership\ngap that must be filled by the next generations. The question is whether or not\nthe Boomers’ successors are up to the challenge.\nWe wanted to find out. We broke EQ scores down into the four generations\nin today’s workplace—Generation Y (18-30 years old), Generation X (31-43\nyears old), Baby Boomers (43-61 years old), and Traditionalists (62-80 years\nold). When we looked at each of the four core EQ skills separately, a huge\ngap emerged between Boomers and Gen Y in self-management. In a nutshell,\nBaby Boomers are much less prone to fly off the handle when things don’t go\ntheir way than the younger generations.\nIt may not appear that this should create any real cause for concern.

So how hard can it be for the l eaders-in-waiting to\nreplace the Easy Rider Generation?\nWithout well-honed self-management skills, it might be a lot harder than\nwe think. Of course, while Gen Y’s approach may be different from the\nBoomers’ approach, many would argue that it isn’t any worse. Actually, when\nyou consider how knowledgeable and technically proficient Gen Yers are,\nthey might even have a leg up on their predecessors in the Information Age.\nHowever, it should be clear by now that there is a lot more to leadership than\nbeing a walking Wikipedia. So, if Gen Yers can’t manage themselves, how\ncan we expect them to manage, much less lead, others?\nAt TalentSmart®, we went round and round debating the possible\nexplanations for this chasm in self-management skill between the experienced\nand youthful. One possibility seemed that coming of age with too many video\ngames, instantaneous Internet gratification, and doting parents has created a\ngeneration of self-indulgent young workers who can’t help but wear their\nemotions on their sleeve in tense situations. However, we weren’t convinced.\nWhen we looked at the data from another angle, the picture became clearer.\nSelf-management skills appear to increase steadily with age—60 year olds\nscored higher than 50 year olds, who scored higher than 40 year olds, and so\non. That means the younger generation’s deficient self-management skills\nhave little to do with things we can’t change like the effects of growing up in\nthe age of iPods and MySpace. Instead, Gen Xers and Gen Yers just haven’t\nhad as much life in which to practice managing their emotions. That’s good\nnews, because practice is something Gen Yers can get. Reversing the hands of\ntime to go back and change their upbringing might be tricky.\n. . . the younger generation’s deficient self-management skills have\nlittle to do with things we can’t change like the effects of growing up\nin the age of iPods and MySpace."

    "text": "This discovery says as much about the malleable nature of EQ as it does\nabout the differences between generations. With practice, anyone can—and\nmany people do—become more skilled at picking up on emotions and\nmanaging them. Developing those skills takes time, but a little conscious\neffort can cut that time down to a fraction of how long it would ordinarily\ntake. One of Gen Y’s signature traits is its enormous capacity to soak up new\ninformation and to acquire new skills. That means it’s almost entirely up to\neach individual to do the legwork necessary to speed up the development pace\nof his or her EQ. For members of Gen Y, the option is to either let years of\nexperience run their course (waiting until their 50s to master their emotions)\nor to take their development into their own hands. If Gen Yers choose to, they\ncan start now. By the time Gen Yers reach their 30s, they can be poised to\nlead like seasoned veterans.\nWith Boomers retiring sooner rather than later, talented twenty-somethings\nnot only can prepare themselves for leadership roles today: the Gen Yers\nmust. Those Gen Yers who take the time and the effort to train themselves to\nresist the temptation to speak when it won’t help a situation, and to keep the\nlines of communication open even when upset, will be the ones who are\ntapped to fill the vacant leadership positions in tomorrow’s organizations.\nAlong with those positions will come not only better pay but also the ability\nto make the changes Gen Yers so desperately want to see in the world around\nthem."

Manual labor by the\ncountry’s 1.3 billion citizens was long considered its sole competitive\nadvantage in the global economy. While American business has turned a blind\neye to the Chinese laborer, the country’s burgeoning skilled workforce now\nstands as the biggest competitive threat to American business today. How did\nthis happen?\nForget that Wal-Mart imports $25 billion annually in goods from China—\nthat’s old news. Today, China has the knowledge workers needed to take hold\nof sectors like finance, telecommunications, and computing. Surprised? You\nshouldn’t be. In 2004, Chinese computer giant Lenovo paid $1.25 billion to\nbuy IBM’s PC division. In 2005, U.S. investors scrambled to get in on the\nbiggest IPO of 2005, a Chinese bank with $521 billion in assets. That IPO\nmarked the first major Chinese financial institution to offer shares overseas,\nand despite its tremendous size, it’s only the third-largest bank in China. Even\nthough the balance of economic power has not totally shifted, it’s no secret\nthat China is America’s single largest creditor. The sleeping giant has indeed\nbeen stirring.\nA few years ago, TalentSmart® researchers decided to see what role EQ\nwas playing in China’s colossal transition from cheap supplier to knowledge\nleader. We spent the summer of 2005 measuring the EQ of 3,000 top\nexecutives in China. Our unexpected findings illustrate the secret ingredients\nof China’s economic success, and a serious threat to America’s ability to\ncompete in the global marketplace: discipline. American executives averaged\n15 points lower than Chinese executives in self-management and relationship\nmanagement.\nThe Chinese executives who participated in the study were homebred\ntalent. All 3,000 were nationals from the public and private sectors who took\nthe Emotional Intelligence Appraisal ® test in Chinese. The executives’ scores\nin self-awareness and social awareness, though a few points higher than the\nU.S. sample, were statistically similar to those of U.S. executives. This means\nexecutives in both countries have a similar awareness of emotions in\nthemselves and others, but Chinese executives use this awareness to their\nbenefit—and actions speak louder than words."

American leaders like how these behaviors\nlook on paper, but they don’t tend to walk their talk. Lip service seems to be\nall the energy U.S. execs are willing to spend on seeking feedback, working\ntogether as a team, getting to know their peers, and following through on\ncommitments.\nMaking business personal is nothing new in China. Executives ordinarily\nschedule dinner meetings with their staff to talk about business trends, career\naspirations, and family. People expect their leaders to set an eminent example\nin how they make decisions, connect with others, and improve. There is\ngenuine shame in not fulfilling these duties because people really care.\nThe implications for the rest of the world are clear: pay attention to\nmanaging emotions or suffer the consequences. Whether for countries trying\nto protect their existing competitive advantage in the global economy or for\nthose nations whose stars are rising, the link between EQ and economic\nprosperity cannot be overestimated. China seems to have a slight advantage\nhere because of the culture in which Chinese execs were raised. If you grow\nup in a culture where emotional outbursts and careless self-gratification are\nnot only discouraged but are also considered personally shameful, such an\nupbringing is going to affect the way you manage yourself and others.
