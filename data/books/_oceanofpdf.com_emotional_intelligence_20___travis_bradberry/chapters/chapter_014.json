  "summary": "As the final curtain draws on our journey, we pause, not for an ending, but for a profound moment of gratitude. This brief, yet immensely significant chapter, 'Contributors,' is a testament to the unseen architects, the dedicated minds who breathed life into these pages. It is here that we honor the intellectual architects â€“ Sue DeLazaro, Melissa Monday, Jean Riley, Lac D. Su, Nick Tasler, Eric Thomas, and Lindsey Zan. Their diverse expertise, marked by the esteemed degrees that follow their names, represents countless hours of research, refinement, and unwavering commitment. Each M.S., Ph.D., and MBA is a beacon of the knowledge poured into the very fabric of this book. They are the silent partners, whose wisdom has enriched every thought, every argument, every nuance you have encountered. This list is more than just names; it is a heart-felt acknowledgment of the collective genius that has made this literary endeavor possible, a foundation of expertise upon which these words firmly stand.",
