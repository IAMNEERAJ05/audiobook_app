  "chapter_title": "Chapter 3 - WHAT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE LOOKS LIKE: UNDERSTANDING THE FOUR SKILLS",
  "summary": "This chapter embarks on an illuminating journey into the core of emotional intelligence, unveiling its foundational elements. We first delve into Personal Competence, a profound inner world encompassing two vital skills. The first, Self-Awareness, invites us to truly *feel* and understand our own emotions in the moment, discerning their origins and patterns. It's an honest, sometimes uncomfortable, gaze inward, where we bravely confront our tendencies not with fear, but with a desire for genuine understanding. This foundational insight allows us to connect with what truly motivates us, making sense of our inner landscape. Flowing from this profound self-knowledge is Self-Management, the active mastery of our emotional responses. It's the remarkable ability to stay flexible, to direct our behavior positively, and to pause amidst overwhelming feelings, choosing thoughtful action over impulsive reaction. Here, our awareness transforms into the power to navigate challenges, putting momentary impulses aside to pursue our most cherished, long-term goals.",
